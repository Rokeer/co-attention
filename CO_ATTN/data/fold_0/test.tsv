4	1	"i think it can happen in our life time because what if  a earthquake happen and all the stores come down or what if  a tornado cane and sweeps upt he store  or what if a hurricane comes like in hati they had a hurricane all their food was gone we had to send or provide food for them. it is always possible for any natural  desater to hsppen in contry, state, city, so my opinion is that what happened in sauri can happen to us to i t can happen in our lifetime any it can happen in any ones lifetime."	5	5		0																					
9	1	"yes, she covinced me by telling me how terrible kenya is right now. the author told us more than 20,000 kids have die in kenya by ÒmalariaÓ. the hostpital doesnÕt have medicine nor water. the author also tells us how the farmers were in danger for theyÕre family. the farmers can rarely grow enough food for the family."	4	5		0																					
31	1	"i think the author thinks its important for kids to know and learn about how life was like in kenya because kenya was a place where it was poor kids couldÕnt go to school, there was no running water or electricity and 20,000 kids would die from a disease. but now kids can go to school and learn, the hospitals are now better and can help cure diseases and bed nets are now used in every sleeping site in sauri."	4	6		1																					
38	1	"yes because basicly the author was saying that if you just set your mind to it your can do anything. also he mentioned that they could be defeated only because theyÕre weak. sauri, kenya is not only a country but itÕs a home to a lot of people. but he didnÕt mention that that its not that easy nor hard to do that."	4	4		0																					
40	1	"yes, proverty is achivevable in our lifetime because the people of sauri made amazing process. now there are no school fees, so many kid's in sauri can go to school. school's now serve's lunch's for the kid's. yala sub-district has medicine for all common diseases for free charge. water is connected to the hospital and they have a great generator so they can have electricity. the hunger crisis has changed by fertilizer and seed's so now people in sauri don't have to worry about starving. now that thing's have changed, kid's can get better education because there are more book's, paper, and pencil's. the kid's of sauri now have a better life's now that thing's have changed in sauri, kenya."	4	3		2																					
41	1	"yes, the author did convince me because with bed nets, thousands of lives can be saved everyday. with bed nets at every sleep site, the amount of people with malaria, can be reduced immensely. this could also reduce the amount of patients in the hospital. this can help patients get better care and more attention. if enough people know about this problem, we could use the most logical solution to solve the problem. another example is farming. the crops on a farm will die without fertilizer. by providing fertilizer, you can save lives, provide better food, and more energy. more energy and nutrishious meals, you can have better future. farming can help in a wide range. school is another example. not a lot of children went to school because of the fees. a lot of people got less than a dollar a day. with no fees, a lot more children could attend school. without school, the more likely chances are that you wonÕt get far in life. the author convinced me because of the dramatic changes, the saving of lives, and better futures."	1	1		3																					
48	1	"i think in our life time overcoming poverty is possible. i hundreds of places all over the world families, villages, and people are living in poverty. if we all work really hard together things should change. when the village in kenya improved so much in just 4 years it showed us that we can over come poverty. in 2004 sauri was very poor no medicin, water, fertilizer, or misquito nets. but in 2008 it had all that so in 2012 it would be better and 2016 even better so by the time its 2040 imagine how advanced and good the village will be. if wealthy people in well functioning citys all give their time like the author did in the text, it would help alot or even if every family in one school, city, or state gave 1 dollar to help stop poverty it would be alot! it would do wonders for a small, poor, village like sauri. there are great organizations like the millennium village project to help 3rd world countries like kenya. so it helps alot if they helped sauri advance in just 4 years and even more organizations did this by 2040 poverty would just be a fact in a history text book. so i do think it is posible to overcome poverty. if we all give back, help, and donate money the world can become a better place and poverty will just be something in the past. i believe it is our job as the next generation to put an end to poverty."	6	5		1																					
49	1	"yes it is achievable because when hannah first went to sauri, kenya it was in proverty, but when the un started a program to help sauri, kenya it had goals. the goals were to get people out of proverty, assure them access to health care, help them stabilize the economy, and improve the quality of life in their communities. these goals are suppost to be met by 2025, and the short-term goals are suppost to  be met by 2015. when hannah went to yala sub-district hospital it was no dotor, no medicine, no water or electricty, and it was 3 kids to disease called malaria that mosquitoes carry and they bite people at night. when hannah went to see the farmers there crops were dying because they had lack of water and fertilizer. kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford the school fees. in 2004, the schools had minimal supplies. kids still wanted to learn. it was hard concentrating because there was no midday meal. in just 4 years the people of sauri made amazing progress. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine. electricity, water, and bednets to keep away the mosquitoes. bed nets are now used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. changes occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. sauri's progress shows that winning the fight against poverty is achievable."	3	3		2																					
54	1	"in 2004, people in sauri, kenya didn't have all of the needs they needed, the united nation starts a program to help sauri, kenya out of poverty. the goals of the millennium villages project was to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care, help them stabalize the economy and the quality life in their communities. during those times, women would sit on the ground and sell bananas. children were running around in bare feet. when people get sick, they went to hospitals and the hospitals doesn't have beds, doctors, water and elecricity, and medicine. malaria was also a problem. it killed kids and make adults sick. in farms, farmers didn't have water and fertilizers to grow their crops faster. the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because of what happened in sauri, kenya. in only 4 years, changes began in kenya. not many people got malaria because of the bed nets they have. also, not alot of people die. in hospitals, they recieved hospital beds, medicine, water, doctors, and also electricity. also, farms got fertilizers and water they needed to grow their crops. the help worked and helped many people"	5	5		3																					
59	1	"i think winning the fight againt poverty is achievable. a major thing they needed was bednets to protect against mosquitos. if everyone in the world got these there would be less deaths each day because of sickness. and water is another thing. everybody in the world needs water. if everybody had water we would be solving half of our problems. people could be clean, their crops could grow, and they wouldnÕt be thirsty. the main thing they need is money. if everybody in the world had enough money to live healthfully we would be happy. if they had money they would be able to buy medicine, clothes, shoes, houses, electricity, food, and fertilizer for crops. they would be able to get a good education and grow up to become doctors. if all the people in poverty had these things they would be able to survive."	4	4		2																					
61	1	"i do think winning the war of poverty is achievable. because in 4 years a simple state in africa turned into a modern state. the hospitles have cures for normal sicknesses, and also have water, school is free and kids have lunch in midday. kenya has improves greatly in 4 years. even thought that was only one place, ending poverty could take many years. but it would be worth it they shouldnÕt give up on this project. and people deserve to have a goal life everyone does. even if its not a paradise it should be a suitable place to live. so not one state is empty and less people die. kenya is a small community but the poeple are very active which is good for a comunity, but the most active countries have more to worry about then we do- we are not an active country and we take advantage of the things we have.while other countries have less than us and dont seem to worry but suffer more than us. we have greater things and yet we dont take advantage of the things we dont suffer to, that other countries suffer to. we should give them what we have in this country they deserve it more than we do and we know that. the project of millenium villages should be encouraged and we should help with it as much as we can."	4	4		1																					
66	1	"yes, because she shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. examples 1: many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents has no money. example 2: in 2004 their hospital has no doctor. the farmers crops were dying and they are worry about that their kids go hungry and become sick and don have enought food to feed the whole family. example 3 in 2008 they have better lift, their hospital now has doctors. their farmers now has enought food to eat."	5	4		2																					
76	1	"i belived that winning the fight agianst poverty is achivable because every problems has a solution. i also think that the millennium is helping alot of poverty. i think that poverty is going to win even tough they are poor they could still fight, for there own rights. this is what i think that you dont have to rich, or poor to win agianst a fight, all you need is courage."	4	4		0																					
81	1	"yes i do think that the author convince us that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time, because in just four years the people of sauri have made amazing process. before kids and pernets hav to share hospital beds and hospitals didnt have all the things that they needed. before there was no running water, and kids died from mosquitos. many kids didnt attend school because the parnets didnt have enough money to pay for their kids to go to school. after the fact now there are better school systems and now the hopitals have become better than what they were before. now when people become ill there's medical to give who evr needs it. i think that with everyone coming togeter as a family this is how all of this became. with out everyone working as a team this couldnt have become, everyone worked together so now they have more money and things that they need. what i can conclude is that change can happen in a life time. this was an example of it. if people work together like a team like a family they can do anything."	4	4		2																					
83	1	"i think it is possible to win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. when hannah first gets to sauri, it is very poor and run-down. people lived on less than a dollar a day, families worried about starvation constantly, the hospital was overcrowded and had few resources, schools were dirty and old. when she first spent time in sauri, it was obvious that to get this town off to a new-start would be a lot of work. a major problem was money; because people didnÕt have enough money, they couldnÕt get the resources they needed. another reason why it was harder is because not a lot of people know about sauri. there isnÕt a lot of general knowledge out there about sauri or its people. aside from working hard, this program sets goals. the people working to make sauri better work even harder so those goals can be achieved by the time set, usually 2015 and some are set by 2025. by working hard and setting goals, the villageÕs general welfare improved greatly half way to their deadline. in 2008 the hospital has all kinds of medicine free of charge, water is connected to the hospital, and they have a generator for electricity. the schools has no fees, and serves lunch, so attendance is way up. bed nets are used in every sleeping area in the village, fertilizer and seeds are given to farmers, along with tools, so they can feed their families. yes it does take time and money for villages to make as big of a turn around as this. a key way to help all poverty-stricken areas change is for everyone to unite and chip in whatever they can and even just lend a hand so we can make sure poverished areas have the same access to resources and oppertunities as we do. then we can be successful and work as a whole, not just individuals."	3	4		2																					
92	1	i think that the author is telling you this cause they want to inform us about how hard life ways in kenya and now how life is much better. the three thing that desribe kenya before was: -pitaful -hard -diffrent in the future the three thing now that desribe kenya was from the milennium -good -easy -diffrent in the past and the new kenya is now good and easy	5	6		0																					
99	1	"i think there is a way to stop poverty in places like sauri. i agree with many of the ideas in the article. i believe that the millenium villages project could greatly improve the current conditions in places like sauri. one idea that i found very helpful, was the fight the better health. this program could protect thousands of children and adults from the deadlu disease known as malaria. just by simpely providing bed nets for people in the village, they could have much better chance at preventing malaria. another aspect of the millenium village project that i think is also very important, is water, fertilizer, knowlege. this program gives the people of the village three very important things. the first two, water and fertilizer, will help the villagers grow crops to feed themselves and make money. the third part, knowledge, will improve the educational system so the children can learn. i believe that the millenium villages project can make the world a better place."	4	4		1																					
102	1	"can poverty be ended in my lifetime? i think that it can, with the right people and the right resources. if everyone contributed, we could end povertyÉforever. there is, however, a vast majority of people in the world who are living in poverty. it seems impossible, but let me tell you, it can. hannah sachs and her family were able to help and oversee this change in a country in africa. sauri, kenya is where the millenium villages project took place in this story. this brings me to my first point, which is that it toke a little amount of time for change, drastic, may i add, toke place in the village sauri. for example, when hannah came in 2004, things werenÕt going so well. people couldnÕt afford nets to protect them from malaria, a terrible disease that comes from mosquitoes. also, people couldnÕt afford education. people couldnÕt even eat due to lack of fertilizer. over the course of 4 years, all of these things changed for the better. hard work and dedication really did pay off. also, because they set themselves a goal. they set themselves a goal to achieve. as we all know, we like to reach and achieve our goals. they were able to achieve it over the course of 4 years. letÕs take the education system, for instance. before the project, people werenÕt being served food in schools and they had to pay for education. now, they are being fed and the school fees arenÕt needed anymore. this is what we need to do to end poverty forever, and to change the world. as i said before, hard work and dedication pay off."	4	4		2																					
103	1	not really because the authorÕs just talking about future mechanisms and things for the future. plus the author also just says things about medicines i did not see antyhing to convince you or me about winning the fight againsist poverty isa cheivable in our lifetime. even though it tells the definition fo poverty to me maybe not anyone else might get convinced but not me.	5	4		0																					
108	1	no this artical did not convince me because now even though the ecanamy over their is still bad but good at the same time. in sauri the mositos still have the desece and nothing really curseÕs the diese the medincen only treats it for a minamal mount of time to do one last thing till you die. over there in sauri poverty is still a problom a little.	4	4		0																					
109	1	- malaria is a disease that mosquitoes give to people if it bites you -their is a net that can stop the mosquitoes that has malaria bit you. -but the people that live in sauri kenya are poverty so that is why children are dying because they can't a ford t	4	4		2																					
112	1	* it doesn't matter who won the fight against poverty. * some people are sick today and there is still a fight going on about poverty who cares some of ower loves ones a hurt because of this fight. we need to stop this fighting and get to know people better because fighting is wrong. *fighting is not gainsta solve this promblem *we need to find a way to top fighting and tell thim that some of ower love one's are sick. we can share ower food and water we don't need to fight we do not half to start some more damage. we all need to get along and be friends.	5	4		0																					
116	1	the author wants kid to learn about how kinya was before and after millennium because she wants them to now that there lucky they donÕt have to pay a lot of money to get in school. they have fresh clothes to wear. shoes to walk around in. and donÕt have to sleep in the same bed. and they have doctors.	2	2		0																					
120	1	"i do believe that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because it will just take some time, like about four to five years.Ó the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. Òthe story said that so we could just farm our food and we donÕt have to spend alot of amount of money. we would just have to risk our lives to live in a place for about a while and wait until we get help or spend our riches so we do survive. my second example is that the mellennium villages project in sauri, kenya worked in just four years so i do believe we would win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. my third example is we could do jobs and earn money or be a doctor so we could protect ourselves."	4	4		0																					
121	1	"yes, because in the story it showed me some examples of how people were in sauri. for example, the disease, malaria made millions of people die. if people help get money for bed nets it will save millions of lives. if people keeps on dieing there will not be anyone who can pass down their traditions and others. kids can learn and help the world but they needed give school fees. not everyone is rich to all those school fees there are also no school supplies. if you teachers expectg the kids to learn you need to get supplies. crops are dying. they need water!! if people help it can really be a great help here are some reasons: once kids grow up and learn they can make new technolgy to help save the world. getting more crops people can survive. peace. who knows but these people can be a great help one day."	4	4		1																					
127	1	"yes because when the girl went there, it is better in 2008 than it was in 2004.  they started a project that helped sauri, kenya with the hospitals, miqutoes, and the sickness.  another reason i think that the fight against poverty is important because in the text, it was talking about how the misquotes hurting everyone that it bit.  the project also help that because in the hospital, there were people in the waiting room waiting to get checked but the doctors couldnÕt them because 1. they couldnÕt pay or 2. the doctors couldnÕt treat them because the doctors didnÕt have water or electricity.  the last reason is that people are always wearing rags and walking around bare-footed.  if they keep doing that, they might catch nimonya.  i think that this project has helped sauri, kenya a lot.  this reminds me of when the sunami happened in japan."	4	5		1																					
134	1	"yes the author of the story of a brighter futher made an good convincing arguement that africa can achieve the fight against provety i say that because they are coming with nets so the people of africa wouldnÕt catch mosquitoes giving off a disaese call maliari which is give off from people sleeping, medicine to cure people that are sick so they wouldnÕt die and people with problem with themself itÕs a hard task to recieve, water and fertilizer because their crops are dying meaning the cannot afford nessary fertilizer and irrigaition so families have to go out their way and plant a seed so they can eat with the lack of feterlizer and water, they will recieve nessary feterlizer and water so each family can eat and not make their own crops, i believe in their families and the goverment will get the children of sauri (sah-ooh-ree) will recieve a chance to get an education, and the school supply, uniform to be able to apply for school. all of the families in africa will recieve money to feed their family so they wouldnÕt have worry about everyday whatÕs they going to eat so i do believe it was a good convicing arugement."	5	5		1																					
141	1	yes i think the author was convincing because she said how the people were porr by saying that she saw kid running with tattered clothes on and she said how the epople survive on less that a dollar a day and se said how she saw a woman selling bananas on the dusty ground. the people of kenya cant afford many things they cant afford much good clothing so all they really have are tattered clothing which they use they walk around the village with no shoes and tattered clothes and so the project will provide people with shoes and clothing. the people of kenya are in poverty they survive on less that 1$ a say in this case they cant by much they cant afford much sometimes not even school! and the project can provide them with money to buy enough food and bigger beds to sleep on. a lot of the people sruvive on selling fruits and vegtables and crops so the 12 year old girl saw a woman on the road selling banans in order to support life and this way she will earn money to get food and waterand a place or bed to sleep in. that is why i say yes because she told us how people are in need and how they cant afford much and how they need help to sustaine life to support families and children and this project will help people alot	5	5		2																					
159	1	"i believe that there are lots of people in kenya who are still living in poverty right now.  with all the poverty going around th epeople will have hard times supporting themselves.  in my opinion weÕll be able to help all the people in poverty to change their lives. the first reason i believe so that the peopleÕs lives can be changed is that there are lots of donaters that are willing to help the poor.  right now my mom is helping a child have a better life.  she donates $25 a month to support the child.  if more people are willing to do this most of the people in kenya will have healthier lives. secondly, i believe that this goal is stil achievable because we have already achieved part of the goal.  in the article is said Òdramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.Ó  this goal have already been done half way.  by 2015 weÕll be able to achieve this no matter what comes.  supporter of the millenium villages projects will help. lastly, the goal of helping the poor will end before i die.  by 2025 when the new goals have been achieved people will start surviving longer.  like the article said Òthe hunger crisis has been adressed with ferlillizers and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply.Ó  now that people are eating enough theyÕll be full of energy and able to work with their new fertillizers and tools.  if they make extra food theyÕll be able to sell them and make money.  soon enough people will be out of poverty.  now that school is free people will be achieving better jobs.  also with free medicine for the most common diease people wouldnÕt have to worry about sickness so much anymore and set their own goals to leave their poverty life. overall, i believe that the goal of edning poverty will be achieved in my lifetime.  like h said Òpart sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó  with all the school time kids have, food people will are planting, and free medicine will help people leave their old life behind.  eventually, the people will climb out their life of doom an dlive a life of happiness.  the children will all have great clothes and everyone will have a good life just like us."	5	5		1																					
162	1	"yes the author did convence it is achievable because she stated in paragraph 5 that Òthe goal will be achived by 015 if not by 2025: so they are sure they can achive this. i am sure they will because i know they are helping people with there supplies and needs like water, fertilizer. schooll supplies and cloths because in the text they said that Òlittle kids were wraped in cloth on there mothers back, or running in barefood with tattered clothsÓ which tells me that they are doing the best they can with providing them with clothing and shoes they need. i also know they can achive because they are talking about the people in poverty and what they need for example they need many things like shelter and food. i know they can do it because it sates that they are doing the most possible.Ó i think its verey nice what they are doing. i would love to help every body there if i could and i know she can do it."	6	6		1																					
168	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverety is achievable.  in the text it says winning the fight against poverty is achievable. also, in the text it say much progress has been made in the last four years like the hospitals are better their new water and electricity and cures to common illnesses. finally, over 80 villages in sub-saharan africa have have dramatic changes. so i do think that winning the fight against povery is achievable because of all this evidence. brainstorming i think that it is possible if people set trying to achieve it they will why donÕt they have the medicine for malaria why did over 20,000 children have to die the crops were dying why they need to go to school itÕs good it has had improvements in 4 years. what are the changes."	5	4		1																					
170	1	"i think the author thinks itÕs important to tell kids in the united states about how life was like in kenya to tell you that you are able to achive anything. i say this because kenya achived a lot of things. for example, kenya didnÕt have any doctors, running water or electricity in the hospital, and some kids couldnÕt go to school because parents couldnÕt afford the fees. the kids that did go to school couldnÕt eat/didnÕt have school lunch. but, to make things better, water and a generator for electricity was running. also, kids could go to school without paying. and lastly, people could buy medicine for free. that is why the author is trying to tell kids that the can achive anything."	4	4		1																					
178	1	"yes, the author did convince that, Òwinning the fight against poverty is possible in our lifetime,Ó because the people of sauri did it.  before, they had many poor people there, now they donÕt.  before 2008, the people of sauri suffered through sickness, no food and supplies, and no fertilizer nor irrigation system, because of poverty.  they couldnÕt afford schools, buy bed nets to keep away mosquitoes, and they couldnÕt afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation system, yet 4 years later they won the fight of poverty.  four years later the hospitals had medicines, free of charge, water is connected to the hospitals.  also, bed nets are used in every sleep site, and there was fertilizers and tools to maintain the food supply.  there are now no more school fees and they serve lunches.  if they could do it in 4 years, i believe if we all work together, all united, we can eliminate poverty, and achieve the win against poverty."	4	4		2																					
182	1	"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime because in 2008 the people in kenya made big improvements like hospitals have water and electrisity. also the hospitals have medicine for most of the comon illnesses in kenya. more improvements made in 2008 were the kids in school had more books and suplies for the school year. and the students get mid day meals now so they have energy thrghtout the day. another improvement made by 2008 was farmers got fertilieser that the can now use to keep their soil fertl, and the farmers could now feed there whole familes with there crops. also in 2008 all the resting places have bed nets to keep mosquitoes with malaria away from the people in africa. if this type of progress can happen in four years then i know we can win the battle against poverty in a lifetime of progress."	4	4		1																					
187	1	"Òwhen my kids are my age, i want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history.Ó stated hannah sachs. this article Òa brighter futureÓ by hannah sachs teachs us a lesson, to use our voices to help/support many people in poverty. they are having this project, Òmillennium villages project.Ó if we just put a little effort that ÒlittleÓ would make a big difference. in this article in convinced me that winning the fight aganist poverty is achiveable in our life time because if we use a little of our time, to support this project & donate just a little money these diesases worries, & wanting would be easy to achive. with the help of the project, these problems would be easier to solve. Òsauri lived on less than $1 a day.Ó if people just use a little less of there money to buy things (they want, not need. we would be able to stregthed this society. if each an everyone of us do that, there wouldnÕt be poverty. that money people donate may be able to save many lives. it is just a dollar, it would help but that dollar might be able to save lives. with those donations, it would be easier to prevent diseases. Òit was hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases people who are near death when the shouldnÕt be.Ó if itÕs that easy i think people sho get together and help. we can make a difference. Òtogether!Ó Òthere are many solutions to the problems that can keep people impoverished.Ó with the money they get they can buy the medicine, water, & food they need. the solutions are simple, yet itÕs really hard to get people to join with our help. we could all save thoses lives. & improve them. it could improve their hospitals & many things. it wouldnÕt be an easy task. but sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight aganist poverty is achiveable if this happens. this world would be a better, more peaceful, world. this econmy wouldnÕt need to worry about starving & money. together we could help. Òwe could make that difference!Ó"	3	2		2																					
191	1	"i think we can win the fight against poverty because a better life was already given to 80 villages in less than 4 years in sauri, kenya. in 2004 the hospital was poor they had no running water and no electricity. they also had no medicine. 20,000 kids died from a disease that was simple to cure. but in 2008 millenium villages supplied the hospital with medicine for common diseases, electricity, and running water. i sounds like a common hospital found in the u.s. which is great. which make step 1 a success. also in 2004 the farmers had no good crops only dry fields because they had no water and fertilizer. in 2008 sauri was supplied with fertilzer and crop seed and tools to maintain crops. with the materials the hunger problem is solved. in 2004 they also had a problem with schools they had very little supplies and students. although students tried hard to learn they were too tired because the schoold doesn't supply lunches. in 2008 the schools have been supplied with materials and now provided with lunch. with that help the students are learning. after millenium villages stepped in sauri has shown amazing progress which also shows towns, villages, and cities can be save from poverty."	4	4		3																					
195	1	"the author partly convinced me but partly didnÕt because in all ten parahraphs, eight of them was about the poverty in kenya, but only 2 was about how much changed, which for some reason didnÕt feel right to me another reason why i was not convinced from the artical was the fact that i already knew of this. assuming iÕm a normal person like everyone else i believe that all the other people knew of this also, and the fact that the ones who are willing to change the world doesnÕt have the means to do so, while the people who does doesnÕt even bother. what partly changed my minds was how it gave examples that shows how a little bit of money can change lives, such as how it said that bug netÕs was only 5$."	2	3		0																					
202	1	"i think the author did convince me that "" winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" in the article it explains how the people in sauri, kenya were only living on less than a dollar a day. also it talks about the terrible hospitlas and lack of food. but now there is hope with the millenuim villages project. there is water in the hopsitals and electricity . there is fertilizer for crops for food. there is school supplies and lunch in school. there are no school  fees costs  for medicines. at the end of the article  hannah explains  that she wants this harshness to be history when she has jids and with this organization it just might happen."	4	4		1																					
203	1	"i think we can win the fight against poverty. if we try hard to make everyone happy, we can achieve our goal. we could send money to the country for them to buy food. also, they could buy medicines so everyone can be healthy. i know this goal will not take a few months or a year. the more we work, the less time it takes. people from other countries can come over to build new buildings and fix the old ones. many doctors can help the sickly people. we can gather money to buy furniture for buildings. if you are determined and you work hard every minute, you can help people get out of poverty. there are much more things to do. i just named a few."	5	5		0																					
209	1	"after reading the article i think the author did convince me by the way she write. the one dollar per day, the disease, the rip cloth, no lunch meal make me feel bad for the kids that live there. i hope the children wonÕt die form the disease. having a disease is a bad thing. if i am there i hope i the family can each have a bed net to keep them by the mosquitoes bitting them. one dollar per day is a hard thing because if i have one dollar i will use it to buy hot chip or maybe curry fish ball, but they have one dollar a day! i donÕt know how to past a day with one dollar. one dollar here, you canÕt even buy a fish. the most you can buy is bread or something like that. if you let me eat bread everyday i rather eat hot chip or something like that. rip clothes. if it is me i will not wear rip clothes and walk around with bare feet. i can get a cold or i can get burn by the ground. good that now the area in africa is more better now. you donÕt need to wear rip clothes and walk around with bare feet. i am happy with that."	3	3		1																					
224	1	"the quality of life can be improved by the milleniu villages. winning the fight against poverty can be achievable in our lifetime. it is possible that we can overcome poverty. we can give money, school supplies & medic i think we can overcome poverty by donating, giving the poor we don't need or sending money. this well help because people in kenya would fight over what we don't need. a little can still make a difference in poverty, we can give people school supplies. it would help kids' education escalate in to a better learning facility. in the story, it says they had minimal school supplies. unlike in america, many students have mnay supplies yet take advantages if them & waste them. another way to overcome povertym is by gicing medicine. in kenya, there are cheap medicines which people can't get. ""the solutions are simple, yet 2,000 kids die from the disease each day."" giving medicine can help kids cure from diseases that already can be fixed. money, school supplies, & medicine can make a huge difference for the future of poverty. these three things can smack poverty right in the face because these three things can make a big difference."	4	4		1																					
232	1	"in my opinion, i think that the author did in this fact (hannah sachs) did convice me that we can win the war against poverty. because, already so many people are helping more and more will come to help, so yes i think it is possible but, also i think that we can not stop an of poverty everywhere. we all have given alot such as school supplies, nets, and fertilizer. if we were going to stop it, it wouldnÕt be in our life time. but, i do believe that we can stop poverty"	6	6		1																					
242	1	"yes~the author did convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life timeÓ, because it was unfair that kids donÕt donÕt have lunch at school. kids have to pay for the pencils, pens, book, and other school supplies. having no lunch at school is bad for kids, because they have no energy to learn. crops are suppose to be healthy for us, like vegetables, fruits, grains, and etc, but if the farmers donÕt have water and fertilizers, the crops will die easily. that wonÕt be nutrition to our bodies. rebuilding and remaking hospitals and roads are going to be a long process. a bed with 2 adults are not going to make you better. hospitals are suppose to heal you and serve you medicines, but if the hospital donÕt have electricity or water, this is going to be worse. i am satisfied that the process was finished in a short time although the people thought of 4 years would be long."	4	5		1																					
249	1	"yes the author convinced me about winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time because it is achievable and because the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free charge, for all of the most common disease. water is connected to the hospital, wich also has a generator for electricty. first they didn't have all that stuff in the hospital and now that they do less kids and less adults are getting sick"	5	4		1

268	1	"hannah sachs really convinced me when she wrote this article. the idea of Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life timeÓ was proven throughout the story. for example, when the people of sauri didnÕt get good health support, people helped change it in 4 years. now ther are no more charges and better medical support. many kids in sauri wanted to go to school, but school fees were pricey, but 4 years later, peole helped to make theschool fees disappear and created school lunches for students. before poele helped, farming was very hard. crops were dying because of the lack of fertilizer and as a result, sauri wasnÕt getting the healhty minerals and nutrients in food that they needed in order to thrive. but 4 years later, people helped to get the people of sauri the food that they need. they gave them fertilizer, seeds, and other tools to maintain the crops. dramatic changes had occurred in 4 years in 80 villages across sub-saharan frica. all of these helpful changes had occurred thanks to the millennium villages project. maybe more changes can can occur if more people help. many changes had occurred in just 4 shor tyears, and if more people help each other, we might even live in a world without poverty. after all, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	4	4		3																					
269	1	i think that we can win the war agenst poverti because in the beginin you would think the begining you would think that it would take a long time because of all of the problems but then in only four years they had amazing sucses. also theirs alote of people helping out in the milenium villages prgect. without the donaters the donaters their would be no progres and no project.	5	4		0																					
271	1	the flight for better health was hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases people who are near death when the shouldnÕt have to be. many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents not afford school fees. dramatic chages have occurred in so villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to the supporters of the millennium villages project.	4	4		0																					
276	1	"the author did indeed convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" one example is how the yala sub-district hospital improved. now, all the medicine there is free of charge. also, water became available because it became connected to the hospital. there was a generator that produced electricity for the hospital as well. also, the schools in sauri, kenya improved, which is another example. there are no more school fees at the schools in sauri. also, they added a midday meal to the schedule. because of this, the attendance rate increased. this has also diminished the rate of poverty in sauri. finally, the bed nets have been placed to every sleeping site in sauri. the nets were worth $5.00, which was expensive to those in poverty. now, poor families will not have to use money to buy bed nets. the bed nets have also the number of people infected with malaria to decrease. to conclude, the millennium villiages project has been improving the town of sauri in kenya. the yala sub-district hospital now has water, electricity, and free medicine. schools in sauri do not have school fees and now have midday meals. bed nets have been placed to very sleeping site in sauri to prevent malaria. these impovements help the people there save money, therefore benefiting the people of sauri."	4	4		3																					
282	1	"i think the article supports the idea of the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time. i think it supports the idea because the text is about the milleium development goals and their determintation to end poverty. in paragraph 1 of the article it states that on their way to sauri, they saw kids running bare footed with tattered clothing. i think the people of sauri should get better jobs with more payments to buy needs such as clothing for their children and them selves. in paragraph 3 it says that the plan was to assure people access to health care. also, to stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. they even set years when their goals shall be accomplished. some goals are for 2015 and 2025. i strongly believe that life will get better in years."	4	4		1

302	1	"before the millennium villages project kenya, africa was horrible. they didnÕt have water, electricity, medicine, no fertilizer for their crops, bed nets, or tools. kids could not even go to school because their parents could not afford it. after the millennium villages project kenya, africa became much better. they now have bednets, water, electricity, medicine, fertilizer for their crops, and tools. so i think the author thinks itÕs important for kids to learn about how life in kenya before and after the millennium villages project because we need to know about how people live in other parts of the world and maybe one day we can make a difference. they improved their school attendance because they took off the school fee. now more kids can go to school and get an education. changes have occured in 80 other villages across sharan africa. the millenium villages project encouraged other villages to do the same thing. before they had bednets 20,000 kids died from malarial each day. their plan was to assure the access to health care and help stabalize the economy and quality of life in their communities. their hospitalÕs were so bad they had to fit three children to one bed and two adults on another bed. the rooms were packed with people who probadly would not even get treated. they had no doctors, only a runnig water. the girl said Òit was hand for her to see people near to death when they shouldnÕt have to beÓ. there was no medicine because the hospital could not afford it. the farmers crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. a family would plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of water and fetiler. every year farmers worry. if they harvest enough food to feed their whole family or will their kids go hungry and become sick. some reasons kids could not go to school is because they had to help with chores, such as fetching water and wood. the schools had minimal supplies such as books, paper, and pencils. the students wanted to learn as much as they could. they all worked hard even with the few supplies they had. it was hard for the kids to concentrate because there was no midday meal. at the end of each school day the kids had no energy. so the millennium villages project dramatically helped the people in africa."	5	5		2																					
303	1	"yes, it might be possible to end poverty in sauri, kenya within this lifetime. however the effects of poverty aren't limited to that village, country, or continent. africa is such a big continent and it took four years to help that village alone. theres also poverty in the americas (north america, central america, south america) throught asia, and even in countries like switzerland, england, france, belguim, netherlands, germany, austria, luxemburg, and liechteinstien. (icould go on but i don't want to.) sure their cases of poverty aren't as extreme but there are still homeless and very poor people there who can't afford to eat. it maybe possible to wipe out poverty in sauri within this lifetime since they progressed so much in those past four years. in sauri the people helping there practically rebuilt the place, fertilizer and tools to ward off starvation. free medicine and bed nets help kill disease there. irragation systems and electricty generators help the hospitals mand make there quality of life better. there are no school fees and served lunch for the students so more kids attend class. my point being these changes have been made in 80 villages there. so the millennium villages project might be able to wipe out poverty for 100(s) of villages within this lifetime. but it's not enough time to destroy poverty in all of africa or the rest of the world."	5	5		1																					
304	1	"i think that the project can be done if they work hard. if they have improved alot in four year, it could change more if the years. they have also put running water in the yala sub district hospital, and a power genorater. there are also almost stopping hunger by helping farmerÕs crops be better. like giving fertilizer, seeds, and tools tools needed to maintain there food supplies. the school has no fees, and they now serve midday lunches so the kid are not hungry. also so they can have energy after they leave the school to come back home. they also have bed nets in every in every sleeping site in sauri to stop the diseases. the disease is called malaria and it kills kids easily after being bitten. on the other hand adults donÕt die easily as kids do, but they can get very sick, so thats why they put bednets in every sleeping to stop the disease from hurting other people."	4	5		2

351	1	i think the author convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because in the article the people in sauri didnÕt have nothing now they have things.  for example the people in sauri didnÕt have any health care.  there was no doctor.  it was 2 adults in one bed and 3 kids in one bed too.  another example family couldnÕt afford things.  some kids couldnÕt afford to go to school because of the school fee .one more example family couldnÕt eat because they didnÕt have fertilizer.  family couldnÕt afford that either.  children would be hungery because there was no food to be planted.  when the kids go to school they have no energy because the children didnÕt get an mid day meal.  but in 2008 everything changed sauri people could afford things and children had mid day meals at school and they had food.  there are doctors in hospital.  thereÕs no more school fees.	4	5		2																					
354	1	"the story has convinced me because when they had said that just in four years things were getting better, so that proved to me that they could really acomplish their goal. paragraphs 13/14 really explain how they improved because they went from proverty having nothing at all, bearly have enough school stuff, and heath things. now they have medicine for heath patients. they have bed nets for people now. also they serve lunches at school for students. this has really has proved to me that if you set your mind to do something you can really make a change to help people who are in need of help. so my answer is yes, because within four years the acomplished a lot they may not be rich but they now have enough to support their community with tools for food, bed nets to sleep in, lunch for students, medicine for people who are sick. in my eyes they have made a big change from what they started out with. they started at the bottom and are working their way up to the top day by day slowly improving."	4	4		2

371	1	"back then the life must have been very hard. now adays we have water, electricity, video games, and food. back then they didnÕt have any of that and it was in africa. it must have been really hot with mosquitos flying everywhere. i heard that the most dangerous animal/bug in the world is the mosquito! also, in the story they said they had no medicine! with bugs that can kill you with a bite flying everywhere, without medicine? ! thatÕs crazy! there was no water there either, humans need water to live! also the farmers will just waste their time trying to grow food whn it want work. every one must be sad. if i was there i know i wouldÕve been sad. i n the hospitals there are three people to one bed!!! they must have been so squished and crowded. also they got no treatment there were no doctors. theres no point in going to hospital if there arenÕt any doctors! but luckily, later on everything was better. they had mosquitos nets for everyone, water, medicine, doctors, and food for everyone. im glad it went better. the end!"	4	4		3																					
375	1	"well, i think we can find against poverty and fix everything and help everybody just like the writer said. don't you think? there are so many possibilities if we just believe in our self and think about others also. one example is disease of malaria in africa. at first the author said: malaria is one disease, common in africa, that is preventable and treatable. and they didn't have enough water, money, and medicines to prevent it. the people just needed $5 nets to prevent it. and once they people got some help the author said: the hospital has medicine free of charge, preventable for all diseases. so that's one way that it can happen. another example is the fertilizer and crops problem. at first the author said: will the kids go hungry and become sick? once they helped prevent that, the author says: the hunger crisis has been addressed to fertilizers and seeds, with more tools to plant. and water for growing. so that's another example that it's possible. school supplies was a problem and people couldn't afford fees and no food! the author at first said: by the end of the day kids had no energy. and couldn't concentrate. and when it was preventable the author said: there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students. that was my last example that it is preventable for anything to happen. so my examples were the diseases, food, and the school supplies. they all were preventable. even though it did take few years. buy everybody is happy. so that's why i say ""yes"" it can be preventable and anything can happen."	2	2		3																					
378	1	"yes, the author convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime, because in 2004 they didnt have everything that they had in 2008. like electricity, food, dishes, ect. some examples the clothes that they wore was tattered, plus they was poverty but as the years had passed they had got better. their goals was to achieved by 2015, but some other targets are set for 2025. some children couldnÕt attend school because their parents couldnÕt afford it. as they go through all of that stress there ploan was to get out of poverty assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the ecomony and quality of life in their communities. they were halfway to 201, and the world is capable of meeting these goals. i infer that as they had confidence and hope that they will reach their goal and it happen it was really meant to be."	6	5		1																					
385	1	i think maybe what's happening is in africa there are people in africa are catching a disses. maybe wahts making them sick is there are mosquitoes carrying malaria which is a sickness people catch when there not in a bednet. a bed net is like a net you sleep in when there's mosquitoes are out a night but only if there carrying malaria. instade of using a bed for you to be conferable instede use a bed net because if could keep to mosquitoe from bitting you. whats happening in africa also is kids and abults are catching a disses because something made them side. maybe whats making them sick is a sickness called malaria. malaria is a disses you could catch if you don't have a bed net to protect you from mosquitoes from bitting you.	5	6		0																					
388	1	"yes i think poverty is escapable 1) bed nets are 5$ each, which is very cheap. 2) there is cheap medicine, that is very useful. 3) hospitals has free medicine. these reasons show that there are cheap, affordable items that are very useful. this is why i believe the world can escape poverty. information in the packet shows that the world is capable of escaping poverty, at least, the world in our lifetime. more ways of showing that the world can escape from poverty is: 1) the people of sauri has made progress in 4 years, most medicines are free of charge and can cure most common diseases. 2) the sauri hospital has water connected to the place and is used as electricity and drinking water."	4	3		3																					
392	1	"no, the author didnÕt.  when the author writes something itÕs suppose to be interesting.  it wasnÕt.  the malaira disease, ok?  itÕs a disease, it didnÕt prove to me you can get rid of poverty, if you can then go head!  but im not convinced, at all.  maybe you can maybe you can but i donÕt beleive you can just get rid of something, you have to work and work.  you canÕt just say it, promising people stuff that is not true. iÕm not convinced, itÕs not convincing.  so if they will, then i admit i was wrong, but guess what?  until then itÕs not happening.  itÕs not convincing, itÕs not anything."	4	4		0																					
399	1	"i belive winning poverty is achievable. i think this beacause the people had made amazing progress in just 4 years. the yala sub district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all the commen diseases. water is connected to the hospitals. they have bednets in every bed in the hospital. the crisis for hunger have been solved with fertiilizer and seeds, as well as tools to help maintain a stable food supply. there are no school feet. schools know serve lunches. dramatic changes have accured in 80 villages across sub-sahara africa."	4	4		1																					
403	1	"peek_020013611 i agree with the author because before this project people were dying and you were living on less than a dollar everyday. also they were dying by a diease called malaria and the only you wouldnÕt get that diease is if you have a net. the net was five dollars and they couldnÕt get a net because they were living on less than a dollar a day. so then aleast 20,000 kids were dying a day because they couldnÕt afford a net. also they barely ate because you if you donÕt have seeds then you donÕt have crops and no crops lead to hunger and hunger leads to starvation. they starvation leads to more people dying. so basically this is just a bad economy to live in until the did that project that yet before that they never gave up because they had what you call it ÒhopeÓ"	4	4		1																					
406	1	"itÕs important for united states to know because, it talks about other countries and how people suffered in kenya. for an example, women in bare feet sat on the dusty ground selling bananas, little kids were wrapped in clothes on their mothers back, and running around barefoot in tattered clothes. after the millennium hospital had medicine, free of charge, their are no school fees, and now the school serves lunch"	4	4		0																					
409	1	"watson_020033217 i think they can because a lot of people in amarica help the poor, and it is a organization/charity. plus the plan has been going on for 8 years and it started 2004 now it is 2012. i bet they got trillions of doller. so far i heard that kenya is doing better on the new thank you"	4	4		0																					
421	1	yes'' because in 2008 the people of sauri have made lots of progress. the  hospital as medicine free of charge for most common dieseases. water is connected to the hospital which also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. hey have fertilizer for plants so food supply has increased. there are no school fees and the school serves lunch.	3	3		1																					
424	1	"what i think is yes, because fighting or winning the achievable is important because fighting for what you need or want is what we needed. the title Òa brighter futureÓ show that their fighting goal in 2015 and 2025. they also say the world are capable to meet there goals. in the Òfight for better healthÓ show that the villages couldnÕt buy a $5 bed net, it prove that they are poor."	5	4		1																					
427	1	"based one the article, the author did convince that ""winning the fight against poverty is acheviable in our lifetime"" because if you keep on working hard you can make a change in the world and it doesn't matter if you are poor or not you can make a change in the world. one example was when the 12 year old girl said ""with the help of the millennium villages project, the place would change dramatically in the comming years. another example from the text was that disease was preventable and treatable, and some medicines where cheap. another example was the bed bets were only $5 and they would help by keeping the mosquitos away from them. and the final example was people wanter to help and even kids helped to. so then from 2004 to 2008, the people did an amazing progress. and there were bed nets, food, and medicines, and supplies from school so kids could go to school."	6	5		2																					
431	1	"this story really moved me. reading this, i feel ashamed of myself. i could have saved lives by donating a little part of my money, but instead i spend it on food, drinks, and clothes. just like the author said, itÕs very sad and illogical. Òbed nets could save millions of livesÓ. while i live my happy life in america. the kids in africa are suffering of sickness. they didnÕt have the ability to attend school either. how could this happen? we are the same kind of species. yet our lives cannot be more different. i was, and still is, relieved to hear that in 2008, dramatic changes has happend to peopleÕs lives. i totally agree that what it takes for changing proverty are a bit of effort in everyone. therefore i am convinced that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó"	5	6		1																					
435	1	"based on this article, i thought that by the way she was saying how much improvement poverty has gotten in sauri, kenya in 2008, i think that they can end poverty. the only thing that confused me was that are they trying to stop poverty in only kenya or only africa, or do they mean the entire world. other than that, i think that they have a reasonable goal. if they are trying to end poverty in kenya. the author convinced me about winning the fight againt poverty in our lifetime because she mentioned that when she visited the hospital in 2004, she noticed that 3 kids had to share a bed, and 2 adults have to share a bed. the patients also didnÕt get the treatment that they needed. there was also no running water or electricity. but in 2008, there was a big difference because the patients were free of charge. you didnÕt have to pay to go to school, farmers were supplied with fertilizer and seeds, in every sleeping site there are bed nets. and in schools, they serve free school lunches."	6	5		2																					
437	1	"i think that that they should help them if it over 2,000 kidÕs dieing a day cause they donÕt have the netÕs and yes she did convince me  by a fight of better health they should have a bed separated for the kidÕs and that fine if the parent sleep with each other"	4	4		1																					
438	1	"yes, the author convinced me that winning the war against poverty in this lifetime is indeed passible. even though sauri was impoverished greatly, the people's needs were met. if this is repeated in other poverty-stricken areas, the world can get rid of poverty! one big problem in the world is the fight for better health. in sauri and other african countries, mosquitoes carry disease, and when they bite people, the people become sick and can even die. if there were more high-tech hospitals, diseased people could get proper care. that way, there could be less death, and people could strive in their own land. another issue that must be addressed us lack of food. once people start providing fertilizer and helping to build irrigation systems in areas without food, people can eat and live. also, water can improve cleanliness and personal hygiene one other thing that must be improved u education. schools everywhere should provide mid-day meals to students. they should also have enough supplies for all. then, the students' future could be improved, so that they could help their land even more. if all of this is done, the world could be poverty- free."	4	4		1																					
445	1	"yes, the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ by saying that the leaders had enough money to give out free medicine for ÒmalariaÓ so that the peoples bodys will heal and get better; letting the children go to school for free also; giving them clean water, good fertilizer. alson eone person made a big change them food and now at their school they have lunch; paper, crayons, scissors, highlighters. also at first the hostpitals could only take one client at a time, but now they can only take about 5 clients at a time. most of the time when a child or adult had ÒmalariaÓ they would just sit in a room alone, but now if there was an emergency like that someone would come in and do the best that they could for the patient. finally the best thing they and we did for them is make and healthy enviorment, les i was convinced that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ."	4	4		0																					
450	1	"yes i agree because in 2004, he schools had minimal supplies like books paper and pencils, but the students wanted to lean. that yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. dramatic change have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa."	4	3		1																					
456	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is possible. because with the help from the millennium villages project alone dramatically changed sauri, kenya. the millennium village project goal is supposed to be reached on 2015 for practical items and healthcare. which is 3yrs away some other goals will be reached on 2025. the rooms were packed with 3 kids to 1 bed. and 2 adults to one bed. there was no running water. patients in hospitals are near death or is to poor to pay for the medicine. there is no doctor and no electricity. some people have deceases that can be cured easily. malaria is one decease that is preventable mosquitos carry malaria, they infect people with it by biting them. kids can die easily from it adults get very sick. a bed net which is $5 can prevent the infection. farmers cops are dying because of no fertilizers. farmers worry because of the lack of water or irrigation and fertilizer and other materials. they barely have enough to have many kids in sauri do not attend school because of the fee is tot much. in 2004 the schools had an minimal school supplies. ever since the millennium village project sauri, kenya has been a better place. and thats why the author convinced me winning the fight against poverty is possible in our lifetime."	3	4		3																					
465	1	i believe that when i am about 70 proverty will be still going on. my answer will be no for proverty being beaten when iÕm 70 because it will take a really long time. first reason if kenya have proverty other country will have proverty too. so there are many other countries and there are 50 states so it took four years of kenya the country to recover. so 50 time four is two-hundred so that will take a really long while. second reason many people need help and they donÕt have much time before that state or country have no more people are living there or long gone. that will be a little too late. even when hannah thought kenya is in a bad envirment. third reason people are not going raise enough money because 50 states and there are a lot of countries in one state. they will take a really long time and that place that raised the money to save that country will have proverty. fourth reason if people keep on saving money for other countries and become having proverty proverty will be going on for a very long time or as i will say it will be going on and for ever. proverty is very hard to prevent from happening to every country to country. fifth reason it will be hard doing the right think if it might happen to you afterward. proverty makes thing hard for people to live for example kenya only earn $1 a day and they canÕt find the money for themselve plus there child. these are the five reasons why proverty might be still going on while even when i turn 70. not that i donÕt believe but its just a prediction if iÕm wrong i believe the world will be a better place to live than ever.	4	4		1																					
481	1	"yes, because so that i can get that matters, not just for me, but other people of the world to. for example: getting a good education for life. to get money for food, water and shelter. to riase a family in good condestion. to change every thing we know in a good way."	5	5		0																					
483	1	i think the article convince me because at millennium village is going through alot of problem because they are talking about alot of kids dieing from the diase and they donÕt have no doctor the help the patient an need so they can get better. they need doctor to take care and now what they doing to the patient in stead of the clinical officer. the parent need money to try to treat there sick kid if they have malaria in there sistem for they can stay longer and have a better life and not to die young buy to live longer life. base on this article i want to help this village to get better.	5	4		0																					
513	1	"kenya was different back then because they didnÕt have things that we have today, like tatterd clothes, school supplies and money for hospitals. also life in kenya now is differnt today, because they have medicine for the hopistal, they provide lunch for kids at school and people have fertilizer to help their crops grow. the inference i will make will be its was hard for people to do things back then in kenya, but right now itÕs easy for them now because they have things they need like clothes, electricity, food, (lunch for kids at school). also they sell bed nets to people that have musquotios with malira inside so kids wont die or adluts wonÕt get sick. also they have water pumping from the pipes, so they can have fresh water to drink and bathe in. and many people became impoverished because of the change that happed in kenya because of the project hannah sachs did to build the millunim village to help people get out of provety (sickness, and health issues in kenya. but now peple are happy now that all of that has passede."	4	4		1																					
515	1	it won't be easy because they need money and crops to fertilizes so kids cap get the food and education they need. there are also people in need for food and supplies so they wont be poor and sick.	4	4		0																					
528	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight agains tpoverty is achievable because in order to help sauri, kenya we have to work together. i can support my answer because in the last paragraph it said it won't be easy and i know that if everybe dy works together and takes part in helping out we can save millions of lifes. another reason i know this is achievable is becaue when it was 2008 suri, kenya was already starting to improve on their economy. i think if we continue helping out they will be even better then they were in 2008. they will get better houses more medicine, fertilizer so that the farmers can plant better foods and vegetables nd also get them more school supplies so that their students can learn better. another reason i know inning the fight is achievable is because we have helped lots of othewr countrys and they improved, like how we helped hati. and that is how the author convinced me tht winning this fight against poverf ty is achievable because if we work reall hard at it dramatic changes will aoccure and help out sauri, kenya."	3	3		1

532	1	it is achievable because in the article from 2004-2008 made a big change in kenya because in 2004 the hospital didÕnt have electricity or water but in 2008 it changed and the hospital did have water and electricity. i think by 2015 the project will be completed.	4	4		0																					
534	1	"yes the author convinced my that winning the fight agaisnt proverty is achievable. because in the texts it says: in 2015 the goals are suppose to be met so that kenya can have better hospitals they have money to spend to buy clothes to buy and plenty of water. in 2008 they half finished in 2008 they got flowing water into the hospital. they have nets to keep mosquitoes out. they have medicine so people in the hospital can life. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply."	6	5		2																					
537	1	"yes, i think they will end poverty because when the auther said Òthey have made amazing progress in just four yearsÓ. i read that the have alot of stuff that they didnÕt have before. that meant to me that 2015/2025 the will have alot of people out of poverty. i think that because when the author said Ò they now have running water and a electric generator and medicineÓ i thought to myself that most of the world will be out of poverty. its also might not end poverty because maybe they wonÕt grow that big. i think that because when it said Òdramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africaÓ, i remembered the meaning of village and it means a small group of people living together as a comunity, and i thought how will they get over 100,000 cities out of poverty."	4	4		1

549	1	"what i think is sooner or later we will win the fight agaisint poverty. if we chip in money for people instead of spending it on toys for kids. say like instead we should be donating water supplies and genarators. think about, people are growing sick and dying from hunger and sickness quickly and kids not having school and not having the proper education they need. what if you were the person running around in raged clothes hungry. not having proper education means no colloge, no colloge means no job, no food or support for your family, no supporut for your family means death from hungrer.  also 20,000 kids die each day from this misquito disease called malria. one way to prevent it is bug bed nets, wich only cost 5 bucks. say your bying a huge bag a chips for 5 dollars instead when you could be saving a kids life!!!"	4	4		1

578	1	yes the author convice me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because it explain that it's real and it said a lot of detail. another thing that why it convice me is because it give a lot of detail how winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime it gonna change there life. i think that these article explain how the people live in kenya and how they live and they try to be strong because they have more problems in there country and it's more different the united stated because they don't have electricity.	5	4		0																					
580	1	"i believe that we can win the fight against poverty. i believe that we can win the fight against because we can donate to the people in sauri, africa bed nets, medicine, water, and food supply. we should put donation boxes to put around san francisco and outside san francisco for people to donate money. we should also put donations bins in churches for people to donate clothes, foods, and bed nets. this can give a change for the people in africa. also in markets, shopping malls, and others should have donation bins and next to it is a donation box. if we achieve these plans less children, adults, and elderly will die in africa. now Òthe people of sauri will have made amazing progress in just four yearsÓ since 2004-2008. i hope the people in sauri will be better in a few years. children of sauri will be able to go to school and have school supplies if we achieved it. someday everony in the world wonÕt be poverty."	4	4		1																					
582	1	"Òmaking a changeÓ i think kenya needs more help from different wealthy countries such as the u.s, china, and possibly england. these countries are just examples, even though kenya is doing a lot better, we as united nations would like to keep them strong. one reason i think many other countries should be participating in this activity or Òfund raiserÓ is because kenya is not wealthy. the people of kenya are just barely holding onto the little bit of what they have. so in order to have another country back on itÕs feet and strong we need to contribute to giving them some nice crops and clothing. maybe even some more schools and teachers. my personal opinion to kenyaÕs poverty, i think itÕs unexceptable because all of these states, provinces, countries and others we have around the world today, are always talking about the money they have but donÕt want to share. thinking back to when the millennium village projects were first starting and was not worldwide. makes me wonder, how did they do it? the millennium village projects took on a big task to save a very poor country from losing all hope of normal lives of satisfaction and sucess. kenya used to be a poor country with no medicine or cures for their everyday diseases. but now look at kenya, a nice lower-middle class society they have schools for free, more crops that are actually eatable. kenya has come a long way with their poverty and depression. kenya is now recieving help from other countries now and arenÕt the poorest country. theyÕre doing alot better with everything."	6	5		0																					
590	1	yes.  i think yes because if life is like that nwo in sauri you could just imagine what itÕs like in the future.  it could also determine the future of other villages.  if their is enough things and needs finished in sauri that were finished in just four years then they would probably be able to the for different villages.	3	3		0																					
592	1	the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is our life time acheivement. i think this because even if we give them all this food and water and fertilizer and every thing they are still going to run out eventually. then they are going to need more of that stuff. then eventually they are going to be able to do it them sleves. they also need teachers and doctors. then for people now how wnat to become teachers and doctors they have to be educated.	4	4		0																					
596	1	"the unpaved dirt road made our car jump as we traveld to the millennium village in sauri kenya. when we reached the village, we walked to the bar sauri primary school to meet the people. welcoming music and singing had almost everyone dancing. the year was 2004, the first time i had ever been to sauri. with the help of millennium villages project, the place would change dramatically in the coming years. the millennium villages project was created to help reach the millennium development goals. the plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quaility of life in their communities. what i know about from the story is about the communities for the childrens to help them learn more, the kids had to go to school to get high grades, and they had to do chores for their parents. thatÕs why kids had to do something good and important. the family is homeless. their parents need to take care of their kids if they donÕt find food and water for the kids they will become sick. the kids in sauri did not attend the school because their parents cannot afford school fees. some of the kids are needed to help with chores, such as fetching water and wood."	3	3		0																					
599	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight againts poverty is achevable in our lifetime"" because in 2004, poverty was taking over sauri but four years later there was electricity, running water, and medicens was put in hospitals, parents will no longer have to pay for their child to go to school and they can also eat lunch. they also have bed nets in every bed in 80 villages so mosquitoes that carry malaria don't have to bite people and make them sick. in 2004 sauri wasn't doing good at all. the hospital was very small and their was no electricity, running water, and it was ran by a clinical officer. malaria killed 20,000 kids each day and made adults very qick. they can buy a bed ned for only $5 but people was so poor there, they could not afford it and later on get sick. some people in sauri would be farmers but a lot of their crops would die because they dont have fertilizer, and if the farmers dont have food for their family the family would be hungry and their children would be very sick from starvation. most people in american don't have to go through this, but other people in cities, states, or even countries around the would has to go through poverty and other people around the world doesnt even know about it but if we team up we could probably fight poverty and get it away for good. if we was stuck in poverty we would want help from other people. so we can just come together and help out like the people who helped out the villagers in sauri, africa."	4	4		1																					
601	1	"yes the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime because for example in the story about sauri kenya it's basicly talking about how they can't really afford anything like fertilizer, water, electrity and children to go to school and more. in our lifetime we can afford all kinds of stuff like that for example they have bed nets which are bugs (mosquitoes) we don't in the bed."	4	4		1																					
602	1	"i think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. i think it is achievable because in 4 years hospitals have medicine, school is free, and farming equipment for food. hospitals used to have limited medicine with 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to bed. now a days each adult has 1 child or adult to a bed. hospitals also provide medicine for all the common diseases so that the children and adults wonÕt die. school has also changed. you used to pay to go to school. now, school is free and provides lunches 8 years ago. kids would come home with little or no energy to finish the day. one last reason is that farmers used to plant seeds, but these would be no crops because of the little fertilizer and water. farmers would worry will i harvest enough crops? will my kids go hungry and become sick? now farmers can survive and harvest enough crops without worrying if there family would survive or become sick. considering the dramatic changes that have occurred in 8 years in sauri, i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	4	4		3																					
605	1	"i believe that we can't fight poverty. i know it's kind of mean, but do you realize how many other countries are in poverty too? well that's why with the technology we have today we can move to areas so we can start over. the richer areas are usually like that because they worked extremely hard to build their nations. if other are as are poor it usually means that their representative/leader didn't work hard enough to help them. so why should we, we hardly not them. (no offense) well there's a difference in being broke and going through hard times. if a natural disasters happened then of course your probably struggling and other countries should help then we would. now you said kids are dying because of mosquitos. what you do is you find a way to fight it. i know that you're provably thinking that ""ohh we don't have any money, what can we do""? well you do what we do in the old days, we barter/trade. every area has something that they have plenty of. so you find other areas who want that and will give you the stuff you need. it's a simple strategy. you should always give something back to a person who gave you something so when you trade you're helping yourself and others. so why give if you don't get anything back. now you also said that you were worried about farming, water, and food. well all you have to do is work out a plan. not come crawling to other countries for the money that they worked hard to earn. all you have to do is think about what you need and what you have. so if you need fertilizer you can make your own, or maybe go to another place and try to barter off whatever you have. water is probably the easiest thing to get i don't even know why you're even asking for it. just go to a body of fresh water and drink. not all kids have to go to school. you can make more schools with a smaller amount of kids so you only have to barter off a little bit of stuff off. when you life in an area that is plentiful of something you begin to get known for that you have. in 1849 there was a gold rush in california and people started to come over and try to strike it rich. then we started to trade gold for other natural resources including oil, water and vegetation so why (for example) would california go over to nevada and say ohh give us some money, we're going to die without it, then nevada dies, so make sure that you should barter, now kill one another and take away hard-earned money."	3	3		1																					
617	1	no its not possidle to stop poverty complety. one example is that there are more people getting born now then ever se that means ther less fod upoming for people and that means provety might increase. my second example is that the economy does not have money because we wasted all of it on a war that we won easily. my third reason is that we help other countrises those countrises might get atteck and lose all their money and we have to strat all over again to help them. my fourth reason is that we have a limtet or the stuff we could give since we are now preety broke.	4	5		0																					
622	1	"winning against provety is acheivable in our lifetime because money is sometime something we everyone need and money is something not to waste but, use it wisely. because in many other states, countries, continents and cities are very poor. i somehow think the place called ""kenya"" was a very poor place because it told that ""children was on the mother back, and running around with tattered clothes"" and tattered mean riped or torned apart. it is kinda like our lifetime because their are many homeless people sitting on the streets. it is also like our city, san francisco, because they their is a lottery place and many adults or teenagers go and by a lottery tickets so they might win the lottery ticket. it is achievable because fighting for provety is also a good thing because their have a place like the lottery place help you. their is also a person who can help but mostly it the money saving companys. i agree with the ""winning against provety is achievable in our lifetime"" because their are many provety, people known as poor people so the government or priesdent help them and that achieve their goals or terms."	4	4		0																					
631	1	"a very serious problem the author persuaded me to think about helping africa and to think about helping the millenium villageÕs project. africa is populated with people that need help and care, something that they donÕt have. malaria is a very common disease in africa that is causeing people to have very depressing lives. for example, people have to sleep under chemicalized bed nets. also, they have to work outside, probably causing them to get malaria, to get money they can use on health supplies. being impoverished is another main problem in africa. poverty is causing children to miss out on the education they need to become better. farmers can not grow crops that they need to eat, and survive. africa is in trouble of becoming sick and impoverished. the millenium villages project may help, but it might not be enough. thse are all very serious problems, as well as fighting for a better health."	3	3		1

639	1	"writing prompt i think Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because of the determination, and strength of the millennium villages project. the determination of the millennium villages project will help make the fight against poverty achieve in our lifetime because the millennium villages project is determined to achieve their goal and they have already Òmade amazing progress in just four years.Ó if they continue to do that, they might be able to help more and more villages until they meet their goal. another way the millennium villages project can make the fight against poverty achieve in our lifetime is their strength. if the millennium villages project can make Òmedicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseasesÓ, Óbed netsÓ to be Òused for every sleeping siteÓ, Òfertilizer and seedsÓ given to people as well as Òthe tools needed to maintain the food supplyÓ, in just four years, then the millennium villages project can reach their goal after seven more years. the determination, and strength of the millennium villages project combined together will help them reach their goal. the determination will give the millennium villages the strength to go on when they want to stop and the strength will lead the millennium villages project to their goal."	3	3		1

667	1	"guenza_020060688 yes, the author did convince me. one example of why i agree with the author is because she mentioned a hospital with many people who were sick and had diseases. but, then throughout the years the hospital eventually had free medical care, and working electricity and water. another reason why i agree is because when the project first started the farmers couldnÕt afford fertilizer, they couldnÕt grow crops because they had no water, and like the hospital, it got better.  the farmers could finally afford fertilizer for their crops and there was enough water to go around which led to people not starving anymore. another example of why i agree is the school crisis. when the project started and even before that the kids parents had to pay fees for their child or children to go to school. they also barely had any supplies, and the schools did not mid-day meals. even through all of that, the schools finally got enough supplies, the schools did not have any more fees, and they started to serve mid-day meals. this leads to better test scores, kids getting a better education and also a healthier school. the last example is that after all that, people finally had enough money so that they could buy things such as; bed nets, to keep the mosquitoes away which kept away malaria, and other things such as food and water. after all that the author did convince me that we can beat poverty. as hard as it can be and how everlong it takes we can win the fight against poverty."	4	5		2

701	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". the author convinced me because in the millenium villages project, the fight against poverty in sauri, kenya was achieved. i know it was achieved because huge improvements were made in sauri. these improvements include no school fees, hunger crisis has been addressed, & the tools have been found to maintain a good food supply. all of these improvements have made huge impacts on sauri. no school fees, have let children go to school, get a good education, without having to pay for. this helps the parents of the children because the amount of money a family lives on is already very low, if there were school fees, the families would be in a dier emergency. the family would not be able to buy enough food, buy good medicines & most importantantly, would not be able to keep the family strong, & bonding together. not having school fees, definiately helps children get a good education & keeps a family strong. not having school feel is something i believe can help all the families in sauri. the hunger crisis being addresed, has helped many people in multiple ways. when the hunger crisis was not addressed, people would starve to death. family members & friends were lost by starvation each & every day. the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya helped many people overcome their hunger crisis. food in the stomachs of many people in sauri, kenya made a huge difference. the items being found to maintain a good food supply helped people in sauri, kenya have a meal daily. a person could look forward to a meal at least once a day instead of once a month. this has helped the food crisis become addressed. thanks to the millennium villages project, the food crisis has been addressed & will hopefully never happen again. the millennium villages project, helped many people in kenya in multiple way and will continue to with help of others."	4	4		3

732	1	"yes because a 12-yeared girl had done it. if she could do it, then we can. the materials and medicine is cheap and easy to get/buy too. their crops were dying but its so easy to grow crops here. if we sent some to sauri. we could feed many mouths! we could also send them used clothing that we dont fit anymore since yearly, we have alot. this 12-year old girl reported that people had contributed water and medical treatment to the people in sauri in just 4 years."	4	5		0																					
739	1	"the author thinks itÕs important because we have all the supplies we need but sauri, kenya has almost nothing. for example, the misquitoes have malairia in sauri, and bed-nets help prevent it. but, the families donÕt have enough money to pay for them. also, the schools canÕt afford to give the children lunch. also, in the hospitals they have not water or electricity and the families canÕt pay for treatment. the farmers also have crops that are dying and canÕt feed their family. the auther is telling how if we all give the millennium villages some of what we have it can make a big difference."	5	4		1																					
748	1	"maybe, because they want us to learn more about them and how thankful we are to have things we have now. maybe the would also want us to help them with their harships. there life was hard, diffcult and painful, before the millenium villages. it was painful, because they were living in africa we they could catch malaria and some of them did not have enough money so some of them from the diease their hospital was not like the ones we have today. the kid and adults had to share beds. some of could not aford anything to help them or the hospital did not have it. the farmers could not aford fertilizer for the plants and crops. they aslo worried if the would have enogh food for the whole family to eat. now the hospital has medicine, free of charge. the hospital aslo has water and electricity. now bed net are in every site that has a bed. now all kids can go to school and eat lunch."	4	4		2																					
762	1	"the convinsed me by stating many facts that can help sauri, kenya. they say that kids die from malria easily and adults can get very sick. the desease killed over 20,000 people but they ahave ways to heel and prevent it at very cheep prices but yet so many die of the deseacs. the hospitals are not any better there are no docters only a clinical officar. many pachents could not afford treatment and even if they could the hospital might not have it the hosipals donÕt have water or elecrity. with todays techoagly we can provide state of the art medisen. be able to transport clean healthy water and elctridy more space in the hospitals"	5	5		1																					
764	1	"i think the project will win poverty because it says they made a lot of progress by 2008 already. also, since they made sauri a good place, they should be able to help other places as well. we have cures for disiese there so people there wonÕt die from disieses as much as they used to. the bed nets also help with that since they keep mosquitoes away, they arenÕt that expensive too. with water and fertilizer, they can get good food by themselves easily now so people wonÕt die from starvation as much. schools will help kids learn to read and write which could help them once they grow up. it seems that it is possible to win poverty but it will just take time."	5	4		2																					
771	1	"i think winning the fight about poverty is achievable and hard to do because the girl said winning the fight is achievable in our lifetime and a hard task. it is also achievable because it helps people from sauri, kenya. she said that if she achieve the fight then people from kenya can have a better life. they would have a better life because the schools would be free, there would be lunches at school, and they would have a better life like us. between the four years progress, they got medicine free, for the people who had diseases. they had fertilizers for the plants and water that was connected with the hospital and made electricity. if they did not do this 20,000 kids will die everyday because of diseases and sickness. that is why they provided free medicine for them. when they finish the project in 2025 they will be much better than before. if they made 100% progress on the project than they would kid of rich. so this is what the project is for. it is to help the people end poverty in sauri, kenya."	5	4		1																					
775	1	"yes we can the auther did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. if we work hard and pay atenson to our goel then we can make it with a dream and effort. food drive, close drive, and raising money are allways to help others. food drives are eazy.food drives are for people who donÕt have money for fresh food and water. the people in kenya re in povity. there the crops are dieing because they donÕt have money for proper fertilizer and irrigation. this is just a little way to help. close bives are when people give old, new and close that donÕt fit. many people canÕt buy close and if they can it is so old that it starts to rip and tair. may kids in kenya that are very little have no close of there own so there parents have to make a little outfit out of there close so they can be held in we are so wacky and just through a way to staff. why donÕt we give them some of the things we donÕt need. raising money lets people buy the things they need. like house, close, food, and water. just the basic acentals. thing for evey day life. the money give kids who donÕt have schools to go to get good education when the kids get out of school they might find a way to end povety so other kids do have to go through the same they went through. life is hard. itÕs harder when you have no one to help you. i dream think about it you could be a poor lost child with no home wonÕt you want some body to help you. so yes we can work hard yes we can stop poverty just say it. yes we can."	3	4		1																					
780	1	"my opinion is that i think your right getting fertilzer i know they needed a lot of stuff. like they needed money, schools, and other stuff but the good thing is i think it's possible. if the people in kenya can then it's possible. i mean it's kindoff sad that the people in kenya had to go through that. i hope that the people in kenya finally have what they always wanted. i think it's possible because in 2004 the people in kenya did it. if they can do it then we can it's sad that alot of kids died. just because of masqiutos those kids could of helped when they had grown up. the people in sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. dramatic changes had occur in 80 villages cross sub sarharan. they tried to fertilizer before 2015 but it was. that's why they needed more time they finally did. i guess it didn't that much long she said she couldn't beleive how much kids died. it was very sad to me that 20,000 kids died."	5	4		1																					
789	1	"i think she wants us to learn about this so we can see all of the struggles the people of kenya went through before the millenium villages project. peopled died from things like malaria. they werenÕt treated properly or werenÕt treated at all in the hospital. life before the millenium villages project was tough, people walked around in tattered clothes. they also had to face poverty. people got malaria form mosquitoes. farmersÕ crops were dying because they couldnÕt afford the correct fertilizer and irrigation. many kids did not go to school because their parents couldnÕt afford school fees. in 2004 the schools did not have many supplies of pencils, paper, and books. the kids were eager to learn so they worked with what they had. life after the millenium villages project improving to get better. now the hospital has medicines to treat the most common diseases. water was connected to the hospital. it also has a generator for electricity. every sleeping site in sauri has a bed net. there is now food supplies to stop the hunger crisis. there are now no school feels and the children get lunch at school. the attendance rate is way up. i see why the author wanted us to learn about this!"	3	4		2																					
804	1	"yes, the author did convice me that Òwinnig the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,Ó i think this because poverty is not a good thing and for the people who can help we should work together. for example children should have proper clothes to wear than torn or ragged clothing. they should have shoeÕs to run around and play in. in a civilized commiung hospital children should not share a bed, that would just make them more sick. people should not die because of poverty, that is cruel. farmerÕs should have fertilizerÕs to help provad food for there family. they shouldnÕnt have to worry about there kids. children should be able to go to school and not worry about what they are going to eat. there should be school supplies for children to learn. that is what i think."	4	4		1																					
805	1	"the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because the author had told me that there wasnÕt good things happening at sauri, kenya. i think that the woman in the market where sat on the dusty ground selling bananas. i also think that they walked over to see the farmers. i also think that the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. i infer that many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford school fees. it is achievable because the unpaved dirt road made there care jump as they traveled to the millennium village in sauri. it is also achievable because there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished."	4	5		0																					
807	1	yes. because when i see poverty people. i think as if that was me how would i feel so every time i see a poverty person if i have money i give them it. because sometimes i have moods when i think that if that was me just laying there i would want money to.	6	5		0																					
810	1	"yes. it's possible to help the world from poverty. i believe we can help the world from food shortages, lack of water, and no medication. if we come together, we can all have a better life. in the story, sauri helped each other and made it a better life by getting free medication to people who need it, and having free food for everyone to cut. this shows that people can work together and change their comminity. if they can do it, then so can we. tools were given to the struggling town of sauri so they can farm more faster and get more plants at once. more food means happies lives for out yong. food gives energy and energy can help you do more efficient ways of doing things like farming, and things. now, children have food to eat, bed nets, and more energy to so chores. all because of 1 donation of a generator and tools. all because of that children have energy, and now they can do more things at school and around the village. we can also do that to local communities to make life easier. we can all make a difference by 1 thing we can all do together. remember, things change about what we do. if we get into a situation like this, otehr contries will help us for what we've done for them."	4	4		2																					
813	1	"i think Òwinning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetimeÓ because it depends on our progress. it also depends on how much we help each other. for example as the millenium projects first started the hospital lacked most of the necessary products, and many adults and kids got sick and died. as for bed nets, they helped you but the people there were too poor to afford it. as for food and water the farmers didnÕt have a lot to grow since they didnÕt have any fertilizer and irrigation, which meant people there barely had enough food. but winning the fight is acheivable if we all work together, and since we haveÉsauri people now lived a better life with more food, shelter, and electricity. so i think winning the fight is possible."	4	4		2																					
816	1	"the author did convince me that winning the war against poverty is achievable but it wonÕt be easy because dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good. also i think that the world would be a better place if there were no diseases, world-wide problems, and wars between countries. so, back to the point, according to the article the millenium project is trying to help people out of poverty by providing supplies for schools, medicine for hospitals, and nets for beds."	5	4		1																					
822	1	"yes the author did because without me reading this article i would not have known a the problems that were and still now happening in africa. i would not have known that that many kids have died from that one diease and i also think itÕs good because after fighting against poverty many more kids were able to go to school the first reason why they wasnÕt able to go to school was because school did not supple mid day food for the kids so i think that the parents didnt want to send the kdis to school because there wasÕnt any food for thema nother eason why it was also good was because they got medicine for the people who need it. one type of nedicne that theyneeded was for malaria because malrai is a diease passed on by a mosquitoe that can kill kids easly and faster than adults. adults will get very sick. the most import recison why i think that itÕs good for the winning fighting for provety is that farmers got the fertillizer they need to plant their crops. so without winning the war of proverty non of these wonderful things will be given to the people to help them survive in the harsh lands of africa also without it many people would have died instead of being 20,000 kids it problay would have been way more about 40,0000 kids dead because their parnets couldnt afford the nets to keep the mosquitoes away from them and their kids also without fertilizer maybe all the farmers crops would have died and they wouldnÕt have no crops to feed from so iÕm very proud that he author included all this deal about kenya africa to add on to my understanding."	4	4		2																					
824	1	"project kenya i think it is possible to end poverty by 2015 because it seems easy but there are more people homeless than you think. it takes a lot of heat to travel all around the world to help everyone before you. but in the end you will be thanked gladly. one example is how the people in the project of milleneum village gave parents money to send their children to school and get a good education. they also helped the farmers by helping crop vegetables and faults. hopefully they will have a good harvest and the lads a good education. another good example is how people are saving lives by donating bed nets for mosquiotes with malaria. people who joined the project will really have good coming there way. i feel so happy for the kids, farmer, sleepers, and the group of people sent on the millenneum village project in kenya. the people who suffer at night by sleeping in a net really have courage to fall asleep at night knowing there are mosquitoes carrying malaria. now thanks to the project workers there are less people in poverty and more doing just fine."	4	5		1																					
826	1	"life in kenya is hard. they had no water, electricity, medicines, and doctors in the hospitals. malaria is a common disease in kenya. it comes from mosquitoes. people die from it everyday. they do not have enough beds for everyone in the hospital. children cannot go to school. their parents could not afford the fees. they had a hunger crisis. crops were dying because their were no fertilizer and irrigation. until the millenuim village project came, they had hope. the millenuim village project changed sauri, kenya. they had a better life. the people in sauri made amazing progress in just four years. now, the yala sub-district hospital had medicine, free of charge, for all most common diseases. today they have water connected to the hospital. also a generator for electricity. now they have bed nets in every sleeping site in sauri, kenya. because of the hunger crisis, today they have fertilizer and seeds for crops. people in sauri, kenya have food to ear. before the millenuim village project, hospitals were out of beds. they donÕt have medicines. also they donÕt have water, electricity, and medicines. malaria is a common disease. mosquitoes carry them around, come at night. kids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick. they had to fight for better health. bed nets keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. when the millenuim village project came, they had medicines, free of charge, for all the most common diseases. they had water connected to the hospitals, and a generator for electricity. bed nets are now used in every sleeping site in sauri, kenya. before the project, farmers canÕt harvest enough food for their family. their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. it was an hunger crisis. time and time again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. after the project affected the village, today they have fertilizer and sees for crops. they had food. i think the author think its important for kids in the u.s. to learn about how life was like in kenya before the millenuim projecet because it was hard. we have to put  ourselves in the position to help others."	5	5		2																					
836	1	"fighting aganist malaria can be achievable in our life time by giving at least 20 dollars a week. it can be achevable by getting electricity to hospitals water for crops and supplies for schools. in 4 years the charity made up a project to help the kenya get out of ripped cloth, health care, and stabilize the econmy. for example: the nets are $5.00 each but for each family is alot of money. so the can't afford to buy their own net. so people are dieing. the kids in kenya want to go to school buy have no supplies. they don't have fees to schools. for example: the kids have no pencils or books so the people don't afford the money to buy the supplies for every kid. some crops are dieing without water. for example: some crops are dieing because their is no food or water for crops. people can't have water because they don't have water for crops. for example in 4 years everything change and their was electricity in hospitals, water for crops, food for people, nets for people, and supplies for kids to go to school and learn."	4	4		1

898	1	"i agree with the author, hannah sachs that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achivable in a lifetime because most people work hard to get what they want. for example, we the people of the us have jobs that pay w money. but in africa they worked hard and get a little bit of money in a day. most people work and work to get money so they can provide things for their family. its not easy at all to get lots and lots of money. we only get a little bit at a time so we can buy what we need. fighting poverty is possible. all you just have to do is work hard and do your job to get the money. sometimes people just donÕt do their work and go broke or they just live in a place where they have little money like africa in 2004 in the story i have read. years a go sauri, kenya they bearly had any thing at all. they had to pay money to go to school, they had a bad hospital with no medicine and a few people to a bed and not enough to feed your family or not enough for you to eat. now they can go to school for free and they have supplies and lunch, have a good running hospital and have enough food as well. before they also got bitten by mosquitoes and maybe died but now they have nets to cover them, protect them, and they also last for five years so they can stay protected from them and not get sick from malaria at all! if a whole village and some others can be better too then you can fight the poverty as well. it went from bad to good in just four years and now it is still up and running for a long time. all they did to achive this was to raise money and work hard to make this all happen and to make it possible so they can all have a better future. we can do it too if we save money and work hard to fight our poverty in the united states. there are lots of homeless and jobless people in the united states and they can fight poverty if they just work hard and save their money to get some very good things in the future. most people donÕt have some sort of job or a little bit of money because of minimum wage. these days it is pretty hard to find a job at all because there is so little jobs these days. people canÕt live on minimum wage forever at all. its hard enough because there might be alot of people in one family and not enought money so they might go hungry and not have the supplies that they need to live. every one can do better and fight poverty just because they work hard and save/donate money to others so they can get the nessicary things that they need to live and be happy. this is just one way and there are lots of ways. i would support every one who is poor and try to help them"	4	4		2

919	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". i think that it is achievable because the author talks about how big the difference there was in 2004 to 2008. that is only 4 years and so much was achieved in that time. personally i thought that it would take much longer just for a little task to be achieved. when i read how much was achieved in 4 years i thought that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" all we need is for the whole world to work together. another way the author did convince me is the way she described the conditions in sauri. the author is only a 12 year old and she discribed the condition  wonderfuly. i think if a well know author who is very well worded wrote this it would of been much more discribeted. when people realize how well worded this 12 year old and they compare it to an older author they realize there is more. the conditions that the 12 year old discribed isn't at all detailed as it actual is over there. people realize how bad they have it over there and begin to compare it to their own life. one last way the author did convince me is that when you put my other two reasons together you get one big reason. it is possible to achieve the fight against poverty because people in today society care. the author has shown me what difference has been made in the little time. we can achieve this fight because we care, we try to relate our life to theirs' and we can't. we think about how spoiled we look compared to them. if the whole world has that thought in mind we can win this fight against poverty one step at a time, together as a team."	5	6		0

927	1	"intro the first reason it is important to/for kids to know about kenya is because when/as we get older then we can helpout with kenya because we have lots of materials & resources that they donÕt have. another reason it is important to/for kids to know about kenya is because in there time/at this present time maybe if we look back into there history & see that they were poor had no food/no $ then maybe we all can learn a lesson from this because like i said, we have more advanced & better & more qualified materials than them, and these days kids & adults are spoiled, we have phones stores, houses & even shoes and clothes but they dont have any of that, but since we do we go out and by ourselves nice things with lots of money & donÕt even think about giving some that $ to kenya where we can donate it to help there country because there in need. 2004 as i know that in 2004 a country called kenya a country in south africa, was a very poor & impoverished place. then the millenium there were many problem for ex: farmers crops died because they didnt have any $, people died from hunger parents couldnt afford school fees, & at school had no midday meals (lunch) on no school supplies. but children still were determined to learn & get a good education. another thing was that when patients went to hospitals, there were no doctors, water/electricity, and on top of that children & adults had to share beds. (there were 2-3 kids in one bed, & there was no $ for one drame. also in 2004 there was a diseases called malaria, a disease when a person is betten by a mosquito. but the good thing was that it was preventable, people had bed nets which cover up the bed so that no insects could get in but not many people had one. the country was just terrible. 2008 then 2008 4 years later the /sauri was /had changed over the years, people didnÕt have to pay for school fees farmers had fertilizer & seed to grow crops, generators at the hospital were used to/for electricity. the hospital had medicine, schools serve meals & attendance at school is up. which is very important because all kids didnÕt go to school then they wouldnt have a good education/they wouldnÕt learn anything. and if they didnÕt have a education then when they get older they wouldnt have a job. conclusion it seem that over the yrs that many people & places have gotten better & progressed thatÕs good how/what happed. because the millenium was a very bad time for them but they still made it. many people dud in millenium but now that there country is better, we still need to help out a bit because/until there country is as good as ours."	3	4		3

944	1	"yes, the author convinced me that Òwinning the figh against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. an example is Òthe people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. i wrote this quote because everything doesnÕt change all at one it takes time, and in this article it took 4 years for them to change. as a result, when they said that Òthe yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseasesÓ i think it helped a lot of people that are sick and people that couldnÕt afford the money to buy medicine. even when they said that Òthe hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizers and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supplyÓ. i wrote this quote because the farmers didnÕt have to worry that much about not having that much food to feed there family and about their crops dying. i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in many ways but it takes time."	4	4		1																					
946	1	"yes it is possible to fight poverty because the author gave all these examples of how the sauri's economy has changed over the four years, for example, more kids are going to school because there are no school fees and the school has lunch, there are more crops because the farmers had enough money to buy fertilizer and have water to grow crops and feed their families, now all of the beds have bed nets to prevent malaria, and the hospital in sauri now has medicine and water for the patients. this shows that the sauri have improved their economy and have won the war against poverty because of chairitys donating to their country. it is achivable because over those four years alot has changed for that country."	4	4		2																					
958	1	"i think that we wont win the fight against poverty becuse they will need more hospitals around the world and more food around the world. their are lots of contries in poverty so their going to need billons of dollars so it will be hard to win the fight against poverty. it took them 4 years for kenya to get better and their are lots of contries that are in poverty so it might take a long time to beat poverty but it still is possible but you would need lots of money and help but atleast they are going to help lots of contries, probaly not all of them."	4	4		0																					
960	1	"yes. the author convinced me ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" like kids in poverty, some don;t go to school because of the fees. also they don't have lunch. now school is free. also they have lunch. another exsample is there are no electricity or running water in the hospital. now there is electricity, mosquitoes spreads malaria. kids get it they die. adults get it they get sick. now theres a cuar for it.

962	1	"yes, i think we can win against poverty in many ways. one example is that people can have a huge amount of money donated to the poor. another example is that the goverment can create more jobs for the poor people. another example is that, public schools can have fundraisers to help build more schools for the kids who canÕt afford to go to school. there can be more hospitals the sick and more farms to grow crops or raise livestocks. the goverment can decrease the taxes or debt that citizens have. money can go to medical research instead of eletronics research, because the medical research can create more medicene and discover medicene that can save people from an unknown disease in the future."	4	5		0																					
973	1	"yes, the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because the progress in sauri, kenya was amazing in just four years. when the author of the article went to sauri in 2004, there were lots of problems in sauri. the hospitl couldnÕt treat patients because they didnÕt have the medicine or the patients couldnÕt afford it. some pateitns are dying with diseases that can be cured. farmers donÕt have the right and necessary fertilzier and irrigation meaning their crops willkeep dyiing and will not have enough food for their families. kids in sauri mostly did not attend schools because parents couldnÕt afford school fees and some kids are needed to help with chores. the schools had minimal supplies and students worked hard to elarn with the few supplies they ahd. kids didnÕt have the energy because there was no midday meal in schools. these problems are big but when the author came back to sauri four years later, the people of sauri made amazing progress. they have solved these problems and lives were improved by the millenium villages project in sauri, kenya. these were very hard and huge problems but they made amazing progress in just four years! this amazing progress convinced me that Òwinnign the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ even though it will be hard and long time."	3	3		1																					
975	1	i would say yes because in just 4 year the people in sauri have made a outstanding chage. i we keep working to help them this will definitely be done and history by 2015 with no dought. in this article it says a disease named malaria is going around. people are dying and getting very sick. like were doing with cancer we should make lots of cures for this. if we could do that we would save millions of live. if everyone on earth sent them $5 dallors they would have enough protection from maliaria for 5 years. we could achieve that. the article also says that the kids in sauri donÕt get lunch so they cant concientrate very well in class. i we sent them money to buy food they could have a better education. with a better education they could learn how to get out of poverty for there family. this might be a hard task but i think we could do it. my dad and i send money to st jude and we could sent stuff to the people in sauri africa too. we can do it if we all try and help the people in poverty	4	4		1																					
982	1	i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable because...... we can give them food. doctors give shots good soyil fertilizer they can have more food for there family they can have more doctors for treatment and medisin they can have soyil for flowers also to grow food they need food because they are hungry and live on a dollar a day it keeps people hellthey	4	4		1																					
988	1	"i believe that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because in this article it shows how much progress we can do to help sauri, kenya. this article convinces me that fighting against proverty is possible because they have accomplished so much in such a little period of time. they only had ten to eleven years which isnÕt a lot of time to help a very proverty village. in the begininng of the article in 2004 when the author went to sauri they had nothing. they had no fertilizer and water to grow plants, bad education system, and a bad hospital. they didnÕt have these things because their economy was bad and people didnÕt have the money to buy things like education for their children or fertilizer to help their plants grow. but as the years pasted, the village of sauri, kenya got better. toward the end of the article in 2008 when the author revisits sauri, kenya, it was a lot better then the first time she went to visit. their farms were better because they had got some fertilizer for their plants and tools needed to maintain it, hospitals had medicine for the common diseases (maleria) and they had a generator inside the hospital for electricity, and finally they had a better education system so education was free to children and they also got an lunch and no one came home with no energy. it took them four years to accomplish a lot of things they wanted. they got a better hospital, education, and food supply. this is the reason why this article convinced me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime."	4	4		3

1013	1	"what do you think?  will poverty be achievable in our lifetime?  well, you may have your opion, but i have my own.  my opion is ther the auther did not  ronvince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is a chievable in our lifetime.Ó  now i have stated my opion, if you are looking for a happy opion, put this paper down and read someone elseÕs paper because this does not have a happy answer, keep reading to find out more about my opion. we can not win the fight against poverty because of a few things:  at the tine people only lived on $1 and the bed nets treated with chemicals that last for 5 years only cost $5 but if you are living on only $1 a day would you want to spend 5 precious dollars when your whole family is starving to the bone?  also you might have a lot of kids and a few beds so that would mean even more than just 1 bed net. the medical is also bad over in kenya.  there are 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed, and packed with patients that would not receive treatment because of space, or because of money.  there was no doctor or running water of electricity, it is a very painful way to die in those hospitals. many people could not find jobs at that village or anywhere else.  it is like that because to find a good paying job would require an education like the one we have now, but it is different in kenya because the village there barly allows you to go to school and when you do there are no supplies, or mid-day lunch.  i would find it hard to concrtate if i did not eat in the middle of school.  afterschool, the kids have no more energy after that, they still need to help with the chores, fetch wood, bring water, tend to the crops, ect.  their lives are very terrible. money is everything, anytime, anywhere, who ever holds the money holds the power.  money is something that is needed for everything it is the most common answer for everything:  why donÕt you have enough food? answer:  not enough money.  money is something that every country needs and wants, and how do you expect a person to live off of $1.  it is almost impossible.  kenya is a place that needs money and time.  not everyone here will give up any of that.  that is why it has not convinced me that winning the war against poverty can be won in a lifetime, mabey 5, 10, 20."	3	4		0																					
1016	1	"yes, i think the author has convinced me to the point were i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because of all they had to go thorw because they first got there they saw women at the market sitting on the dusty ground and kids were in cloth raped aound there mother backs, or running around bare feet and tattered clothing. when they got to the hospital it was not in good shape there were three kids to abed and two adults to bed. there also was no doctor only a clinical officer running the hostpial. there was no running water or electircy. it was hard to see sick people with preventable diseases. and in the four years kenya has been in great progress and the hostpital was in good shape now that over the four years they worded on it so thatÕs really 4 z think winning the fight anigst proverty is achivheable in a lifetime because of how long they worked and what them work on it"	4	4		0																					
1017	1	"i am convinced because people all over the world are helping out with people that are in poverey. it will take a long time, but profress will occur and people will be out of poverty. i know it will take a long time because in the text it says the goals are supposed to be met by 2015. i also think that better crop treatment (essential for food) can be treated. i know this because the millenium villages people have supplied sauri with fertalizer and seeds. also, i know that diseases can be treated because they supplied bed nets for every sleeping site. more people have helped with the project, supporting what they are doing to not just sauri, but former 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. less people were impoverished after the project, and many more will be the same if more people help with projects like this one."	4	4		2																					
1018	1	"i think that ending poverty in my lifetime is possible, but only in our region. poverty will be in the world for a long time, and maybe even forever. the millennium village project ended poverty in sauri, kenya, so i believe it is possible to end it in many villages around the world. however, there are not enough organizations to end all poverty. even if there was, there would not be enough sponserors for every single organization. as it stated in the text, sauriÕs progress proved that poverty can be ended for good. if it will end in our lifetime, it still has a chance of coming back. resources are always changing and improving and areas with poverty might not be able to catch up with them. so those areas will end up having the not-improved technology, and be in poverty again. as i said before, many people are not willing to sponsor the organizations. they would rather buy the new iphone or a kindle."	5	5		0																					
1031	1	"i think the author is correct in saying that it is possible to win the war over poverty because if people can help a small place in 4 years, then in 8-10 years is the estimated time for another town in great need. for the author to go to sauri in 2004 and see something like that and then in 2008 she looks at a new sauri with schools, bed nets, hosptial, and mosst important the food and crops. also, when the author went to go see the farmers, they had no food or crops so if we help them get more then they need, they can give the remainder for the poor and the needy. i also like how the hospitals improved a lot and how now pacients can trust their health and the doctors helping them. a good improvement for sure is the bed nets because they decreased the rate of people dying of malaria."	5	4		2

1051	1	"based on the passage i just read, i think winning the fight against poverty is not possible because i believe that no matter how amazing progress they make in the next hundred years, there will be always people that are richer than the others and there will always people who are selfish. if people were not that selfish, i acutally believe that we could actually will the fight against poverty, but the fact is no one is not selfish. for example in the text where they say Òthe rooms were packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it.Ó this qoute shows how selfish people are actually is because they always will help the people that are rich. even myself is selfish, so i donÕt think is possible to win the fight against poverty. some people think that we could actully win the fight against poverty because the technology are getting better and better, but i have to just disgreed because even if the technology are getting better dosenÕt mean people will change. people are smart. they know what are good for them and what are not. and eventually people are gonna get smarter and smarter as the time goes on. for esample in the text where they said Òthe people have made amazing progress in just four years, water is connected to the hospital, also has a generator for electricity.Ó and this text show how people are getting smarter. again i strongly believe that people will not win the fight against poverty because there will alway people that are selfish and more rich. and even if the technology are getting better, there will always a limit."	3	4		1

1073	1	the author did convince me Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. 1 of the examples she gave us was 80 villages across sub-saharan africa dramaticly changed. the second example she gave us was that they made amazing progress such as fretilizaing crops and letting them grow. the final examples is  more food for the children and adults and provided water and medicane for the hospitle. i think the author was right about the quate.	4	4		1																					
1081	1	"no, because there are way too many people to heal and feed. like when they said Òeach day 20,000 kids die from malaria.Ó providing medicine and food to people would cost a lot of money. it would take a lot of people in the world to improve the poor countries. plus in the text in says 20,000 kids die each day. if you count it all up in a year or even a month there would be a lot of kids. even though they said that the people of sauri had made an amazing progress. i still think that they couldnÕt heal and provide food to every single people. there are many villages in africa that they havenÕt gone through. and they said Òthey had gone through 80 villages across sub-saharan africaÓ. and it says sub-saharan africa only. i bet that everyone in every part of africa is suffering too. and we have to take out our own money to support the oter country. and soon we would be bankrupt too. unless everyone chip in  a bit. but most of us canÕt afford it. when they said Òthe bed nets can save millions of livesÓ, we have to feed millions of people too. and that would cost a lot. so i donÕt think they could achieve their goal."	4	3		3

1090	1	i agree with the author that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time. because look at how much the life in sauri had improved just in 4 years! before the millennium villages project these people were suffering because of preventable and treatable disease! if each family had just a few more dollers than they do they could buy a bed net and they will not get very sick or die from disease like malaria. if these people had enough money they will not be starving to death. kids will be able to go to school with better supplies and have school lunch to eat. the millennium villages project just used 4 years! in 4 years many treatable problems were solved. what caused these problems is poverty. if we can donate some money to help them many other villages in africa that are still in poverty could be helped. even if we just donate $1 that would be very helpfull. if everyone in california donates $1 that would be about 30-40 million dollers to donate! see $1 dosenÕt mean much to us. but it will be a huge number of money if everybody donates $1. as long as we work together to help the people to villages like sauri i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.	3	3		1

1142	1	"132501y2_ 100264524 yes, because they need to take caure of there health, but the can't, because of the poverty. also, because the children need an egucation, but they can't get it because they have to stay home and do chores. something else is that the can't afford to take care of themselves. the world can make a diffrence, but it takes time. another thing is i think that we can achieve our goal because it takes time. example 2008 they got bed nets, water, and electricity for the hospital. it just take time."	4	4		1																					
1147	1	"what i thought i think the author thinks it is important for the children of united state to learn about how life was before and after millinnium village project because it make them know more about the meaning of proverty and they would also know it as history if not, they would think that proverty still exicts and they would also think that they would be poor like them. i think she wrote this so that they would also know lives can change. before there were no facilities for planting or fartilizer. people were very poor that they could not afford money for their children school fees. they shared little beds in the hospital and at home. after they had fertilizer for plantig they had medicines free for common disease. they had enough food and money lunch in school was free."	4	5		1																					
1149	1	"yes, the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. in the text it says the plan to get people out of poverty is to assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. villages get technical advice and practical items, such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies. the goals are supposed to be met by 2015, other targets are set for 2025.we are halfway to 2015, and the world is capable of meeting these goals."	5	5		0																					
1152	1	"i think that poverty can be eliminated in this generationÕs lifetime because simple things can be done to help those in need. before the millenium project the people in sauri didnÕt have simple things that could have easily made life better. things like medicine that could easily be afforded in the us werenÕt avalible. a misquito net that cost only five dollars was something that most families could not afford; hospitals were over crowded and many people couldnÕt afford basic medical treatments. there was no water or electricity. but in only four short years the hospital was transformed into a medical center that could be found in the us. people could get free treatments, there was medicine, people had clean water and could see a doctor. farming in sauri was very hard. without things like fertilizer or irrigation crops could easily die and leave a family without food. the people in sauri had to struggle in order to eat. when the millenium project gave farmers the tools they needed to grow crops the quality of life vastly improved. all in only four years. many children in sauri didnÕt go to school. those who did found that there werenÕt enough things such as books and pencils. the majority of students didnÕt eat a midday meal and therefore had no energy by the end of the day. four years later the number of students has increased. they now recieve lunch and have enough school supplies. life for the people of sauri has vastly improved. all with very simple things in a short amount of time. fighting poverty was done by giving those in need very simple things like medicine and food. if a place can make great strides towards bettering the life of its people so quickly and easily, then ending poverty all over the world could easily be achieved in a lifetime."	4	4		2																					
1153	1	the author convinced that fighting poverty is acheivable in our lifetime. in the text it says at first people did not have money and any access to health care and no school supplies. the text also states that people did not have enough money for bed nets or medecine to fight malariah. many hospitals did not have any electricity or enough beds. at the end of every person in the village had a bed net and electricity also the scools had school supplies. this explains that the author did acheive his purpose because at the begining the village had about nothing but now they have many supplies.	5	4		2																					
1161	1	"i believe Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ is achievable. i believe its achievable because the costs of medicine isnÕt too high so people should be able to donate a reasonal amount of money to help peopleÕs life. if bed nets only cost five dollars, people should be able to donate that amount because its a reasonable amount. five dollars can save a person from dying of malaria. farmers and their families also have hard times. farmers live in the fear that their crops wonÕt grow because they cannot aford the proper fertlizer and irrigation. without their crops their families can suffer. their family could starve and become sick, or even worse die of starvation. if they had proper fertilizer and irrigation, they wouldnÕt have to live in fear. children also suffer. unlike us, we fortunatly have school, while children in sauri donÕt hget a chance at education. they dont get the privlage of education like us because their families cannot aforde the school fees. the school can hardly afford supplies as well. in 2004, the school had very little supplies but the children still worked hard and tried their best to concetrate. schools also didnÕt have midday meals, so children were low on energy. some kids did chores such as fetching water and wood instead of attending school. people in sauri are suffering. they donÕt have or get the privilages we do, but i do believe we can change that."	4	4		1																					
1163	1	"yes the author convinced me that the fight against proverty is achievable because they already started. i know it is achievable because they already started helping with the hospital, the schools, and the crops. they helped with the problem of the mosketoes they made medicine if you got a infection from it and they made a bed net so the people dont get the disease. anothe way is if kids dont have the amout of money to sent thier children to school we sent them to school but they didnt have food so by the end of the day the children dont have the right amount of energy they need so we payed for food to give them. the people even gae furtalizer to the people of the village. and that is why even though they have done so much every body can do more! together."	5	5		2																					
1166	1	"the purpose of this paper is to identify if based on the article did the author convince me if ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". i say yes because if we all put our parts and like work together to help than sauri, keny than trust and believe that we can change all the poorness and they will be able to have better education and way better doctors at the hospital. i say this because in the text it said that in the hospital they didn't have water or electrisity. but over the past years they work to make it better and now they have water and electrisity and if we keep working or if they keep working they can make it even better. if i had the chance to change that poorness i would so the kids can have a way better future and better education. the reason i say this is because reading this artical made me think that its not fair that i have like alot of thing and still think its not enough and there kids out there that have nothing compare to me. if i had the chance to go and help them i would, i would anything thats possible to help those kids get a better education and help them get more clos and shoes. (back to the question) yes i think the author story support his point of view to see how this people made a big differances in there life."	4	5		1																					
1175	1	"the author did not convince me that we can win the fight of poverty in our lifetime. one example is beccause when she first went to sauri, little kids were ""running around in bare feet ad tattered clothing."" this shows that they can't afford shoes or better clothing, and it would probably take a lot of money to buy showes and clothes for every single person. also, the farmers' ""crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation."" this problem has been solved by gifts of fertilizer, seeds, and tools. however, the farmers still need a way to get water for their crops. another flaw is that ""there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital."" although the conditions of the hospital have gotten better, what if lots of patients are sick, but there's only one person who have to tend to everyone? who would the clinical officer choose to tend first? i think the hospital could be even better if there were real doctors, and more than one."	5	4		3																					
1180	1	"i think that the author think it is imortant for kids to learn about keya because we sould be happy that they have maidsend now & so we will under sand how it was then & how it changed. kenya be for, more than 20,000 kids die from this every day, they did not have a cure than also, people fell so sad & ill. inset of pay 5 $ for a sud you can save a line. now kenya we have a cure and a lot of people do not die fron it doctor can heple and we work togeter to fix it and we have"	4	4		0																					
1210	1	"the author did convince me that you can fight poverty because in 2008 hospitals had medicine to fight diseases, also they had water connected to the hospital, and had a generator for electricity. in schools they started to have more supplies for students, had lunches, there was no school fees, and attendance rate was up. these are examples that when something seems hard or impossible you should never let go and if you fail and fall, you canÕt give up there you got to get up and keep on trying till you suceed. the village of millennium thought that compliting these goals were going to be hard to accomplish. then they noticed that if they tried their hardest and work together they could accomplish impossible stuff could turn to possible stuff. if kenya could accomplish something that seemed impossible why canÕt we do something challenging?"	4	4		1																					
1219	1	"yes, i agree with the author that the life in the millennium villages in sauri kenya can be improved because the author of this article hannah sachs actually went to kenya and saw the poverty like there was not enough money for bed nets and people of kenya started getting malaria and now there is improvment shown like bed nets and more medicine so sauri, kenya can be improved. i believe sauri can be improved like more fertilizer and irrigation and also medicine for the yala sub-district hospital. it has shown loads of improvement and the attendence in schools. Òit has gone way upÓ like the author says. but i disagree with the author that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because at this point there is hardly any money. the economy is so low. there is thousands and thousands of poverty and there always will be. it doesnÕt seem very logic and realistic that one day there would be no poverty. there are many things that need improvement and we can make little improvements that make a big difference. but i donÕt see how the fight against poverty is achievable at this point in the world. i agree with the author that sauri and other places have shown improvement and will keep showing improvement if everyone helps. but i know that isnÕt going to happen there are different types of people who donÕt even care about what is going on and only care about their money. that will never change. so in conclusion i believe since the economy is so bad their is alot of selfish people who donÕt want to help and because of the numbers of the poverty. i believe the fight for poverty will not occur. but it can show little improvements that make a big difference and i hope one day there will be no poverty. but i donÕt think there goals will need by the date of 2015."	4	4		0																					
1229	1	"no, i do not think that ending poverty is achievable in one lifetime. africa is a big continent and just sauri alone took about four years. itÕs not mission impossible but it will take time and a century is not going to do it. like sachs said in her text, sauri didnÕt even have water nor electricity on command. electricity might not be that important but water is efficient. in hospitals, water is needed for cleaning wounds. there is also another problem here because medicines are lacking. malaria is a serious disease, maybe not in america but back in sauri, people are dying every single day because of that. there are easy cures for malaria but adults and kids are dying simply because they donÕt have the money to buy medicine. this disease is something you can prevent yet itÕs affecting people because they donÕt have that five dollars to buy a bed net. the lack of food is also a important cause of deaths. farmers are trying to grow crops and produce food themselves but itÕs impossible to have decent results when crops are constantly dying. fertilizers are constantly needed for the cropsÕ growth but farmers also donÕt have the extra money to do that. winning against poverty isnÕt impossible but it will take plenty of time. one lifetime isnÕt enough to end it but it will make it better. maybe over the course of a few centuries, poverty will finally be history."	4	4		3																					
1230	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight over proverty is acheivable in our lifetime. what the author said in the article told me that people are being sick of proverty. kids and adults are dieing because of malaria in their skin. because of proverty, people has to share beds in hopsitals without being treated. plants die because no water and fertilizer. because of proverty, people can not buy bed nets. without bed nets, kids are easily geting bitten by mosquitoes. with bed nets, a community can be saved. in sauri, people has to share beds in hopsitales without being treated. with proverty, people can't be treated and without proverty people can be treated. farmers worry because of dieing plans. htey need water and fertilizer to feed their plants. without proverty, farmers can feed their families for a period of time. withour proverty people can use bed nets, people can be treated, farmers could feed their families. the author had convinced me that winning a fight over proverty is achievable in our lifetime."	5	5		1																					
1236	1	"Òhelp is comingÓ when the author first arrived in kenya all she could see was poverty all around her. i think the author wants kids to learn about life in kenya before and after the millenium villages project because the more people know about the life the more they can help to make a big difference todayÕs society. one of the common dieseases in africa is malaria. malaria is taking out most of the population of kids each day. their is a way not to get malaria but since the country is so poor that canÕt afford it. since malaria is spread at night by mosquitoes their are bed nets to keep people from getting malaria. bed nets are treated with a chemical and can last up to 5 years but a bed net cost $5 which most of the country cannot afford. another problem before the millenium village project is lack of water and fertilizer. most families try to do subsistence farming but it does not work out. subsistence farming is where a farmer grows crops to only meet the famalies needs. a family will plant seeds hoping for food to grow only to see that their is a lack of crops because their is no fertizer or water to help the crops grow. most kids in kenya do not attend school. the fees for school are high so parents cannot afford it. at the school their is minimal supplies so kids donÕt really have much to work with. also, the school does not provide a meal during the day so many kids donÕt have much energy. thanks to the millenium village project, life in kenya has been improving. bed nets are now used in every sleeping site, hospitals now have medicines for common dieseases and their are now more fertilizer seeds. i think that since more people have more knowledge on the different ways of life they can make a big difference."	5	5		3																					
1247	1	"winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time. i think this because we could donate money to the people that are in proverty. we could also donate things like clothes and food so they donÕt have to buy any. we could ask people to help. we could have prizes for people who donate the most money or clothes and food. it might be something that a lot of people want or it could be something rare. we could ask stores/shops to donate money. people could donate paper, pencils, pens, markers, notebooks, and other school supply for the people that donÕt have enough money to buy school supplies. we could also send money to the school so children could go to school. the people that canÕt afford to go to school would be able to go to school. we could also send them a doctor so they could get examined properly. the clinical officer might not know what he/she are doing. we could also send a bunch of doctor to treat more than one patient at a time. we could send them beds. this way they wonÕt have to share a bed with somebody. we could also send them bed nets not not a lot of people will die as easily. this is why i think we could win the fight against proverty in our lifetime. this way nobody would feel the need to steal."	4	4		2

1272	1	"this story was a touching one, but i donÕt believe we can beat world poverty in our lifetime. let me give you several reasons why. firstly, the world is huge. they might have helped 80 villages, but there are probably hundreds more out in the world. the author says herself Òit will not be an easy task.Ó i think that we donÕt have the resources to give everything needed to every village in the world. itÕs just not pratical. secondly, see how long it took to help just one village to get up to pratical and useful materials? 4 years. that is 1/3 of my entire life. if most villages in poverty are this bad, think how long it will take to help all of the villages in need. the author says Òthe people of sauri have made amazing progress in 4 years.Ó i focus on the 4 years part of the statement. an average person lives to about 75-80. there is just not enough time. thirdly, i donÕt know if enough people are willing to go and help. my family would, but we need thousands, mabey even hundreds of thousands of families to help. i donÕt think enough people would get off their lazy butts and go down to help people like those in sauri. the author say Òwe travel town a bumpy road to the village of sauri.Ó we, could mean two people to several people. but i just donÕt think enough people will volunteer. youÕve heard my opinion on resources, time, and people power. i donÕt think we will be able to give help to everyone in our life time. iÕm not saying it will never happen, but not for while now. all in all, i donÕt think it can happen in our lifetime."	4	5		3																					
1276	1	"i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. if they could help a so much communities that much in only four years, it is possible to help other villages. she says, Òthe solutions are simpleÓ. i believe this because she also says that there were big changes in 80 villages of africa. i believe that it is achievable in our life time because even though there are big problems, there are easy ways of solving them. she says, Òthe world is capable of meeting these goals.Ó i think she is saying that not everyone is in poverty and have the ability to help others, so we should do what we can to help. she is showing us that not everyone is as fortunate as we are and that there are ways to solve the problem, but in order for them to be solved we have to participate. she shows that the plan is effective by showing us that there has been a lot of progress in so little time."	4	4		2

1287	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because in just 4 years sauri made a lot of progress. in 2004, common diseases that were treatable like malaria couldn't be cured in sauri. 20,000 kids die in one day because of malaria in sauri back in 2004. but in 2008, just 4 years, this common disease and many other common diseases were curable. also, back in 2004, there was no water and electricity running in the hospital. that is not good since water is important. but then, in 2008, there was water connected to the hospital and a generator for electricity in the hospital. before in 2004, bed nets that were to prevents mosquitos with malaria were not owned by many because they were $5 each. but in 2008, every sleeping site in sauri had a bed net. there was much progress in 2008, but that's not all. before when kids went to school, they were always tired after school ended because they didn't have a midday meal. we all need 3 meals a day and having one meal less will damage our body and will make us very tired. but in 2008, sauri had a midday meal for school and the fee for school was a better education. these events that happened in just 4 years proves to me and the world that if you try, you can do it. sauri made so much progress in just four years. that's how much time we spend in highschool. we can win the fight against proverty with time, patience, and teamwork."	5	5		2																					
1288	1	"winning the fight well, in my opinion i think winning the fight against poverty may not happen. i think that because there are too many villages or people in need. poverty is horrible but itÕs really hard to make it dissapear. first of all, poverty is is nearly impossible to get rid of. i think that because all the villages and people in need. itÕs such a big number that is nearly impossible. even if the people have crops and hospitals that acually grow and work poverty will still happen to some people. even if the people of sauri and others have medicine and fertilzer, poverty may still happen. secondly, the goal is in 2015 which is in 3 years. probably the millennium village project is also done. and they started in 2004 but in 2008 everything started to be better. since they had fertilizer, water, electricity, cure for diseases, and a working hospital. itÕs still a very hard achievement to be accomplish by 2015. if they actually accomplish it iÕd be very suprised that that goal would be complete by 2015. but there are other goals to accomplish. there are other goals to accomplish by the time period 2025. lastly, it said that in 2008 that kids were attending school because there was more equipment and a midday meal. it said that Òattendace rate went way upÓ. but still poverty is a hard thing to get rid of because all the people who only spend $1 to spend for things they need like food, water, and clothes. also they need bed nets since of mosquitoes which carry malaria and could kill lot of children and adults. so itÕs a very hard to deal with. and bed nets cost $5 so itÕs hard. so poverty is very hard to get rid out and deal with. in conclusion, poverty is nearly impossible to get rid of. and itÕs even more hard to deal with. lotÕs of people die from no food or no medicine. so i think winning the fight of poverty is not going to happen."	5	5		1

1366	1	"the author did convince me, because he tells how it possible to be done in 2015 or 2025 and i think that it is possible. i think it's possible because they said that they'de get unified to do it. if they get unified than it will be inpossible to stop them. and i would help to stop poverty because 1st of all people could die of starvation from poverty. 2nd people go homeless because they don't have a job to pay for a home because they don't have a deploma and/or a education to run behind the deploma. 3rd poverty has it's own rules and it involves medical needs so if you have medical needs but no money to pay it's possible you can die because you can't aford what you need. also sometimes people wear ragged clothing because they don't have a job to earn money to get new clothing because of poverty. i would participate because i would like to stop homeless from being homeless, also to stop people from starving their selves so they won't die of starvation, and last i would donate clothes, toys, shoes, and caned foods to people in need of it. i think it would be the right thing to do."	4	4		0																					
1375	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because she showed me how many people in sauri, kenya need our help against poverty. like they need money to get treatment form the hospital. and that the hospital needs all kids of things like running water, electricity, and doctors. it also told me how the people in sauri need money so their kids can get an education school supplies, and midday meal. it also told me how they can't afford bed nets - so they don't catch malaria. the people in sauri has a plan that meets in 2015 about people getting out of poverty, to assure them to access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. and to help them they needed technical advice and practical items like fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. they hope it would help them get out of poverty. some farmer's crops are dying because they can't afford fertilizer and irrigation. and sometimes they worry if their kids go hungry. in sauri, kenya some kids get malaria and can't get it treated because they can't afford it. kids die from it easily and adults get sick from it. there are cheap medicines to get rid of malaria, but yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. and there's  bed nets that are treated with chemicals that would last for 5 years. bed nets keep mosquitoes away and it could save millions of lives. some kids in sauri, kenya did not go to school because their parents couldn't afford it. the schools didn't have supplies, midday meals, education, or students. kids has to help out by fetching water and wood. some kids couldn't concentrate with the little supplies the school had. and some had no energy. now there are many solutions to the probelms. hospitals has medicine, free of charge, of all disease. hospitals now have water and electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri, kenya. and fertilizer has been addressed of the hunger. kids can afford schools and the schools serve lunch. sauri's progress shows me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	5	5		2

1463	1	"did you know in 2004, the people of sauri only lived on a dollar or less a day? poverty has been a big deal in many countries. can winning the fight against poverty possible? i strongly believe that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. when hanna sachs visited sauri, kenya in 2004, she saw how bad the hospitals were. there were three kids a bed and two adults a bed. many patients weren't able to be treated because they were too poor to pay for treatments, or the hospitals didn't have the treatment for the sick patients. in 2008, hospitals had medicine that was free of charge for common diseases, and there was clean water. the people of sauri has made great progress in just four years for hospitals, but hospitals aren't the only things that were improved. farming was also improved. in 2004, crops were dying from lack of water and fertilizer. farmers would always worry about whether they would be able to grow enough crops for their families. four years later, the hunger issue was solved. the people of sauri had more fertilizer and seeds, plus tools that would help them maintain their crops. in 2004, many kids in sauri didn't go to school. kids didn't have the money to pay for the schools, so they helped with chores. in 2008, many kids went to schools. meals were free and they had more supplies. in just four amazing years, sauri, kenya made great progress. hospitals, farming, and schools were improved. if the millennium project fought against poverty and won, you can too. the fight against poverty is achievable."	4	4		3																					
1464	1	"yes, as long if people are willing to help and not be selfish. it convinces us that we can fight poverty because in the text it shows from 2004 when they were in poverty but in 2008 poverty stopped and changed back to be regular people. they changed by giving medicines for free and they also didnÕt have to pay to go to school anymore. in the text it also says Òbed nets are used in every sleeping sit in sauri.Ó while before in 2004, every kid in school didnÕt have midday meals(lunch) and by the end of the day, the kid would have no energy. in 2008, every kid in sauri would have lunch and also serve lunch. those are the reasons i think it is yes."	5	5		1																					
1468	1	"yes, the article did convince me because the author says when she came back to sauri, kenya she said it was getting better. the village had more medican and people who are in poverty can now afford a couple of stuff like the Òbed net.Ó i also think that it wonÕt be way because in the article the author says Òit wonÕt be a easy task.Ó i agree with that because many villages are living in poverty, by this project villages in africa wonÕt be in poverty , have more medican and have water and electricity going through hospital. people in sauri, kenya are having a better life, before the authour worte that this village hospital did not have any running water or electricity. there was no doctors just a clinical officer running the hospital. kids would run barefoot with tattered clothing. parents could not afford school for there kids but with the millennium village project kids donÕt have to pay for the books or pencils. and have midday meals."	4	5		1																					
1472	1	"i believe Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because having to note that people in the world not just in suari, kenya donÕt have much, such as, a school to earn an education. for school fees were high at cost to the families of poverity money. also, in schools children didnÕt have enough of books, pencils, paper. since most children didnÕt go to school they were expected to help do chores in the house, get firewood, farm, and many other chores. many people didnÕt have lunch, which lead to low energy = sick. if you were sick the hospital provided you with medincine for free yet on the other had they only had medicines for common diseases like malaria caused by mosquitoesÕ bites. in kenya bed nets helped prevented bites. therefore, with the fact of families are poor, without much education, frequently sick/ill you can conclude that to end this the mellenium villages project will support to reduce the struggles of people in sauri, kenya."	4	4		1																					
1474	1	"i think we could win the fight against poverty and achieve something. they got fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. if they donÕt have the medicine they will die. if they donÕt have the fertilizer they wonÕt be able to eat any of the food. if they donÕt have school supplies they wonÕt be to learn any thing. they need of these things to be able to survive."	2	2		1																					
1476	1	"yes, the author did convince me because they achive in there lifetime, for example some people in 2004 in the hospital they didnÕt have alot of medicines, doctors or beds. and now they have already alot of medicines and i think a bigger hospital. another problem that they had is that some people were so poor that they canÕt even pay $5 dollars for a mosquitoes net, and they needed one because the mosquitoes can kill kids and adults can get very sick, and in school they didnÕt have no supplies or money for there food for school and know in 2008 they have the mosquitoes nets without paying money, and know they donÕt have to pay for there food know they get there food for free and got more supplies so that they can use it at school."	5	4		2																					
1481	1	"chan_020044676 yes the author did convince us because in the article, he state that the hospital have no doctor and no water but after the process in 4 years, there are medicines that cures common diseases and water plus electricity for free. bed nets used to cost about $5, but now, every sleeping site in sauri have one. they canÕt maintain the food supply back then and now they have every tool for food supply. people couldnÕt  attend schools before the process but after the school fee was free and there are lunch meals after the process."	4	3		2																					
1482	1	"i think the author did convince me because in the text it said in the fight for better health people easily get malaria. they get malaria by mosquitoe bites and get very sick. and also died. in water, fertilizer, knowledge farmers crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. in a better life - 2008 people of sauri have made amazing progress. but sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achivable in our lifetime."	4	3		0																					
1484	1	yes because in 4 year they fix medicine disease with in 4 year they save lives maybe in 4 more year they will have more school supplies with a litte time we can make kenya a better for visters peopel how live there for every one.	5	4		0																					
1487	1	"poverty can be stopped, because in the article it says that in 2008, things got better. like water in the hostpital and school supplys. also there are fertilizers for seeds, so if people farm, they can sell crops for money. people will be living and poverty will be gone. the nets to prevent mosquitoe bites will save lives of people. if people live, there will be more money for things in sauri. more materials will be there for chores. incluing food. the money help give more food. the food would be provided more around sauri. by now, sauri should not be a poor place. there should be more health care around. more houses and buildings should be around now. sauri should be able to have people and things around. clothin should be better. it should be like the u.s.aÕs cloths. it shouldÕt be rags. and also, water should come out clean and fresh. even to take a shower. the school supplys should be handy a lot. pollution shouldÕt happen. the air should be fresh and streets should be concrete. cars are supposed to be build to drive around. there should be more communication like phones or mail. electricity should be around also. there should be shelter and protection. there should be even animals to eat. also animals to help for the protection."	4	4		0																					
1494	1	"yes, because in the text a girl that was twelve years old went to a country in africa and saw the poor people that couldnÕt buy food couldnÕt go to school, and couldnÕt pant crops to feed their kids, so she set up programs when she came back to help the people in need of food education and other things."	5	5		0																					
1496	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? well, yes it is because with help from everyone they can get what they want. like it said in paragraph 2 in water, fertilizer, knowledge even with the little supplies the kids owned they still wanted to learn. they tried their hardest with what they had. i feel that if they had the chance or opperitunite to stop proverty they will do it. it talks about how they spend less than a dollor a day. we spend more then 10 dollors a day. so if we donate a some money, clothes and hire doctors it could help them so much. the fight for better health paragraph 3 says Òthe net that stops malaria mosquitoes from sleeping people only cost 5 dollors.Ó of course to them thats to much because they are poor and cant afford it. but, imagine if we can buy some and send it to them. the nets can save millions of people. we can spread the word of stopping poverty. i think that citys or states should open storos and hospitils in africa and hire people with no jobs. doing that will give them some money to pay for their needs. examples like paying for their heath care, food, clothes, and housing. it might be a little hard because of the time it takes and all the money. but, its better to start doing better know and start saving lives."	3	3		1																					
1498	1	the author convinced me about the people in sauri had suffered. the farmerÕs crops are dying. the farmerÕs are worried if their kids with have enough food or will they be sick. many people in sauri have died from malaria. people in sauri has bad fertility and water. they recieve less rain and more sunshine. many kids in sauri didnÕt attend school because many kids canÕt afford it. many poor people had died from malaria. many of their crops was worn out and many of them had been dry. they donÕt have much money. they all can afford bed nets. when it was 2008 people donated enough money so that we can buy bednets for people in sauri that has malaria. now they have enough money for kids to go to school.	4	4		2																					
1504	1	"the author did make winning afight against proverty convincing by the information she gave on the peopleÕs ways of living in sauri such as the low money rate and school attendence which both werenÕt making the village any better.in sauri their arenÕt enough space for seperate beds and people.as stated there was three kids to a bed and two adulls to one also. there was also no light nor water which which caused sick people to set their selfs to a night of heat and darkness of a hospital. their diseases where mostly caused by a mosquitoes that carry malaria that wasnÕt prevented by a net.most africans werent able to by a net for 5 due to them reciving a dollar every day. most children werenÕt able to go to school due to the fees.which caused the studentÕs family to give up breakfast, dinner and lunch for their sons and daughters to attend school were school is free for us and weÕre able to also eat.she also made it convincing by here us being able to eat fresh crops from the garden due to fertilization which keep our crops clean and kills bugs. i wonder what gave the u.s itÕs riches but killed the sauriÕs fame. soon, it would be rebuilt. thats why i found it convincing."	4	4		1																					
1506	1	"what the author was saying was that poor kids are dieing from dieseases and they cant aford the shots. i think what they are doing now is pretty good the have some food and education and a better life. so i think the author convince me and it is very possible to win the fight against poverty it is very achievable we just need to plan it, get funds from places get money, get people on our side to help against poverty. but it might take a hole life time. the author says ""what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good,"" and a other the author saying ""when my kids are my age, i want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history."" maybe in the future we can change poverty and the kid in the united states can send clothes to the poor like and example: ""where kids were wrapped in some coth on there mothers back and how kids are running around barefoot. and fund food to all the hungry poor people in those 3rd world countrys dieing everyday. like they cant aford a shot that cost like $5 and they get it and they can maybe die without the shot. its really sad to see this and hear about. i think im convinced with this article"	4	4		1																					
1508	1	"yes, we can make the people in millenium villages have a better life because in the project their was some things that we could do to make the people from millennium villages. have a better life. for example in the passage it says Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ and that gives me an idea to stop the poverty and let the millennium villages people to have a better life and not a bad life and a lot of people die in only one day. second example is that we should have school supply for school and for the kids to have better learning. they should have school lunch for the student too so they could have enertgy to learn more. third example is that at the hospital they should have water and electricity in the hospital. they should have doctor and nurses to take care the millennium villages when they get sick. the fourth example is that the farmer should have enough seed to plant crops so the farmer donÕt have to worry all the time that him or his family wonÕt have enough food to eat and the farmer have to worry that their kids will get hungry and then sick so if they have enough seeds or fertilizer so the farmer donÕt have to worry about their family donÕt have enough food anymore. the fifth example is tha the millennium villagers should have cloth to wear so they donÕt have to wear tattered and play with their feet without wearing shoes or flip flops."	4	4		1																					
1509	1	yes because even a small amount of people can change the world for example the aritcle says that they created somthing to help pepole not get sick and they are called bed nets they keep the moscitoe away and they also changed school fees so people can afford it.  and they improved like the hospital stop charging people and let them go for free.  i infer that the village will stay the same.  i also think that it is good that people are getting better.	4	4		1																					
1513	1	"118691y2_100054877 i think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó is true, because we can prevent poverty and save millions of lives, by producing cheaper bed nets, riches fertilizer for crops, and more school supplies. the author explained that the people of sauri, kenya are struggling and Òwe the peopleÓ can make a difference by producing more foods crops and producing richer fertilizer. the people of sauri, kenya need a lot more bed nets to prevent malaria which is a disease from mosquitos. sauri, kenya have been producing for themselves from 2007-2008 which is 4 years straight. the plan is to get people out of proverty."	3	2		1																					
1514	1	"yes, i think that we can save people in sauri, kenya and all over the world with the millennium villages project. i think yes because look at what happened to kenya in 4 years. now they have a new hospital with clean running water and electricity generator so if the power goes out they will still have electricity. also the medicine is free of charge, for all of the most common disease. in 2004 they didnÕt have a good hospital with no doctor, no water and electricity, and 3 child whould be to a bed and 2 adults to a bed. also people couldnÕt get treatment because they chould not afford it or the hospital didnÕt have it. schoolÕs did not have enough school supplies and lunch was not provided to the children. now in 2008 the school has more school supplies also school was free an the schools now surves school lunches. also the schools attendance rate is way up. now in saur all over saur all bedrooms have mosquitoe nets cost $5.00 and only a few people could afford it. now that farmerÕs have ferterlizer and water. so the crops are now growing and the food supply problem was solved with tools like seeds and ferterlizer. before they got the ferterlizer the farmerÕs whould not have enough food to feed there familyÕs. also with out ferterlize the plants were dieing. they were scared that there children will go hungry and become sick and die. dracatic changes have occurred in so villages across sub-saharan africa."	4	4		2																					
1516	1	yes because in the text it talks about. disease kids and people have like malaria. it talks about kids not having clothes and not having a lot to eat. thereÕs a lot in are world we all can help on of 3 states. its not hard. thatÕs why i think we can achieve this in are life time. i infer if we donÕt achieve this in are life time. then someone will later on. i also think this is possible. i think it possible because. thereÕs doctors medic and people that really can help. just like kony 12 we can have millennium villages 12 so a lot of people can help them.	4	4		0																					
1520	1	"i think that we will be able acheive this goal because we have already fixed so much in these 4 years. because people are more educated they can start to become more sanitary to prevent some sicknesses. if people do become sick they can go to a good hospital like the yala sub-district hospital with water, medicine, and bed nets. the food problem is pretty much solved because of the fertilizers. the fertilizers made the crops grow better than before and then people were not starving as much, and the water also helped the crops grow. one of the things that we have solved is the education problem. by making the schools free, the parents can afford for their kids to go to school. the school supplies also helped strengthen the quality of education. over all alot of changes have been made to help fight poverty and the poor living conditions. this goal will be achieved."	4	5		2																					
1522	1	"winning the fight against poverty is possible because of all that has happened in 2008. having medicine, water, and electricity is all free in kenya. these supplies mainly fi all of kenyas problems. although the poverty issue isn't solved, the article states ""we are halfway to 2015"". we are hear 2015. hearing all these advantages from 2008, there is a high chance of solving this issue i believe that this issue will be solved."	5	5		2																					
1524	1	"the aurthor provide a convincing argument that winning against proverty because it is not fair that you has to pay for school. and they should grow more crops in kenya had no medicine. but now they have electricty, water, food. and thats how you live in the country."	3	3		1																					
1529	1	"yes, the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. the changes in four years were much better. there enough supplies for everyone, including food, water, and work materials. the people donÕt have to pay for supploes or school fee. well, maybe later in the upcoming years but iÕm positive the jobs will be available by then and they will have money to pay. children are also eager to learn so there will be more concentration on schools too. each four years will be different and there will be more changes than we think there is going to be. the fertilizer and water that the people of sauri got will be able to grow crops. hospitals will be able to treat patients and children will have a better education at school with school supplies and a midday meal to keep them going. deaths will decrease over the years, iÕm sure of it."	4	4		2																					
1538	1	"the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because lots and lots of people in sauri, kenya were in proverty and were dying because of malaria caried by mosquitoes and had something called a bed net that cost $5 and since it cost $5 people were living in poverty so they couldÕnt buy it and people kept on dying. the solutions are simple but yet 20,000 kids died from the disease each day. and the bed nets could save lots of people life but they had a cheap medicine to get rid of malaria. also many kid needed and wanted knowledge but it was hard to get because their parents could not afford shcool fees. and the kid at school didnÕt have a minimal of supplies like books, pencils, and parpe and without those things they couldÕnt learn but they stilled worked hard with the few supplies they had. it was hard for them to concentrate, and there was no midday meal so they starved and by the end of the day the kid didÕnt have energy and crops were dying because farmers couldÕnt afford fertilizer and irrigation or water so people started dying because if there no fertilizer thereÕs no food and if thereÕs no food lots of people die. but now people have better lifes now theirs hospitals, medicine, generator, electricity, bed nets, fertilizer and seeds, school fees, lunch, the attendance rate is way up and everything was accomplish to what they allways thought their goal to be."	4	5		3																					
1545	1	"i think the first against is possible but just will take alot of work. i think itÕs alot of work because if you fight against poverty and beat it in one place then another place will need it and another. another reason why itÕs achievable is because the millenium villages project already helped the people of sauri by helping the yala sub-district hospital get medicine, free of charge, for the most common diseases and connecting water and an electricity generator to the hospiter. the millenium villages project also helped by placing bed nets in every sleeping site in sauri and delivering fertilizer & seeds as well as tools needed to maintain the food supply. the schools now have no school fees, and the schools now serve lunch for the students. based on this article written by hannah sachs she did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	4	4		2																					
1550	1	"no the arthor is lying about everything he say, itÕs not true because iÕm rich"	4	4		0																					
1553	1	"the author convinced me that it is achievable in our lifetime because in the text it says 'the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. the yala sub-district has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital wich also has a enerator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in suari. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds. as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no school fees, and ther school now serves lunch for the students. the attendance rate is way up!! the progress they have made is good and i beileve they can take it farther."	3	4		0																					
1554	1	"yes i think its convincing because winning the fight of proverty is good because millenium village helped proverty people when they came to these village like the village they walked in to meet - the school people welcoming music was playing singing had almost everyone dancing the joined alone in clapp with the joyful music. at the time she visited kenya with her father in 2004 when the project was just beginning, at the time people lived in sauri lived on less then a dollar a day. but the plan was to get out of proverty access to health care stabilize the economy and quality of life community villages get technical advices and practical items such as medicine and school supplies the village leaders in yala sub district hospital was not in good shape the rooms were packed with patients malaria is a disease that comes from mosquitos in can kill you some people dont have money to pay or medicine in can die 20,000 kids died from malaria. they walked over to see the farmers their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer in irrigation time in again a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water."	4	4		1																					
1558	1	"the millennium village project plan is to get the people out of proverty, assure them acces to healthcare, also help them stabilize the economy and quality of  life in their communities. at 1st they didnst have good clothes because where wearing tattered clothes. tattered mean torn and ragged. when they say the want them out of proverty. i know that means poor with littel or now money. the project goals are sit for 2015. any other time is 2025. some example are no doctors, no water or electricity. they had no medican, not enogh beds in the hospital because 3 kids go to 1 bed, and 2 adults go to another bed together. today they have medacan, electricity, running clean water and even bed nets. bednets are nets that you put over tent while you are sleeping so that mosquitoes canÕt bite you while you are sleep and give you malaria. thatÕs because everyday 20,000 kids bie from malaria. i think we should know about kenya so that we can respect and appreceationate what we all ready have here in usa. thatÕs because in kenya those people had nothing and still donÕt. then here we are in one of the richs contrys on earth, and we  did not car, try to help, know about kenya. to tell you the truth i did not even know kenya exzied until may 21, 2010. mothers lose their kids everyday in kenya. in the unisted state mothers lose their mind because of their kids. today we all need to be thankful that we are alive. really i think we think about our selfs to much. half parents donÕt even support their children. we have good schools, doctors, water, & electricity. they hardly have anything i just. so i think we should help the people in kenya and the people running the project. u.s could at least donate money to kenya. the kids are getting labtops and donÕt know how to use it. how about instead of labtops and education, hospitals, how about doctors, house, and beds for every one."	4	4		1																					
1560	1	"i do think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó i believe tis because there are so many people trying to help the situation already. there will probably be way more in the upcoming years to come. a couple of years ago healthcare was a big issue. adults and children were suffering from diseases that are very easy to prevent, like malaria. the way to prevent it was by buying bed nets. each one costs 5 dollars, but they were living off of less than one dollar a day so they couldnÕt afford it. but now every sleeping site in sauri has a bed net so now malaria can be prevented. another issue that occured in the past was the lack of fertilizer and water for crops. in the farms in sauri all of the crops were dying because the farmers couldnÕt afford the neccesary fertilizer for the crops. farmers always worry about their children and think that they wonÕt be able to feed their entire family, this happens every year. also children couldnÕt attend school because their parents couldnÕt afford it. children usually had to do chores and couldnt learn. but for the children who could attend school it wasnt any better. the schools were lacking school supplies like pencils and paper. but now they have tools for planting food and can now afford fertilizer. schools are better now too because there is no school fees anymore. so now every child can attend school. we have done so much for sauri and many more cities and countries. dramatic changes are happening for a better life ad at this rate we can create a better society for everyone."	5	4		3																					
1570	1	"yes, because in ""a better life-2008"" paragraph 2  is says dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub- saharan africa. in "" water, fertilizer, knowledge  paragraph 1 it says,  the farmers crops were dying, because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an otucome of poor crops , because of lack of fertiizer and waer."	6	5		1																					
1582	1	it can be improed by having more bed net in the texts it says nets coust five dallars. some kids do not go to school the texts tell that they don't go because they don't afford it. i think they should always have a docater in the hospital. the story said their was only clinical officer like a mom that helps all people. i feel the arthor convince me. beating poverty is achievable because if americans make $6 a hour. i think my praents afford atless one and that one could lifes.	5	5		1																					
1593	1	"i think the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya really helped and will probably help a lot more later in the future. four years after the project started sauri, kenya improved and got better. imagine what sauri, kenya would be like in 2025 if the millennium villages project still exists. the yala sub-district hospital now has medicine for the most common diseases in sauri kenya.  it is also free of charge which would save many more lives then in 2004 and before that. if any person is sick they just need to go to the hospital and get treated. the millennium project also provided water and electricity for the hospital and provided bed nets in every sleeping site in sauri. that will prevent people from getting malaria and from people dying from it as well. the water and electricity will help the hospital by a lot too. the hunger problem has also been improved with fertilizer and seeds, aswell as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. the schools in sauri, kenya also serve school lunch and there are no school fees. the millennium villages project helped sauri, kenya so much with there problems."	5	5		2																					
1594	1	"yes, i think they can beat poverty because in the text it says they beat off a horrable disease that killed 20,000 kids and they said they had low school supplies but the kids still wanted to learn. so thats why i said yes because it show how hard they work to survie."	4	4		1																					
1596	1	"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. one reason i was convinced about winning the fight of poverty is because the hospitals could have medcine. so the children could go to the hospitals and feel better with the medicine that the doctors give us. my second reason why the article has convinced me is because the familys and children get electricity. they could be able"	4	5		0

1616	1	yes the author did convince me that winning a fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because the author used his/hers time and money to got to kenya and help these people who suffering from disease and hunger and all these othe stuff that have a effect on them.  the author was like a super hero just in a different way.  the author made me think that im so lucky that i got a home and i got money to live on.  i could just keep on going in life but they cant.  thats why this author convinced me to help the people in need.	4	5		0																					
1621	1	"in hannah sachÕs Òa brighter futureÓ, the author explains the milennium village projectÕs sucess. she talks about the hospitals, ariculture, and education. in sauri, hospitals were with Òno running water or electricity.Ó the disease of malaria was common even with the sale of bed nets. these people live off of less then a dollar a day but the nets cost five dollars making it too expensive. after a few years, all the people have bed nets. now making the goal of 2015 possible. the argiculture in 2004 was ÒdyingÓ without the Ònecessary fertilizer and irrigation.Ó farmers worry about famine and the fear that their children may go hungry. after four years, the shortage of food Òhas been adressed with fertilizer and seedsÓ with tools Òto maintain the food supply.Ó this shows the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. education in sauri was not sucessful because of the high Òschool fees.Ó others did not attend because they were Òneeded to help with chores.Ó the schools themselves did not hae enough Òbooks, paper, and pencils.Ó children could not ÒconcentrateÓ because Òthere was no midday meal.Ó in 2008, there were Òno school fees.Ó lunch was served, resulting in the Òattendance rateÓ going Òway up.Ó with this, the 2015 goal will be possible in our lifetime. the success of this project is shown with their argiculture, medicene, and education. each were about failing at the beginning, but after four years, it is revived. this all shows that this goal is achivable in our lifetime."	5	5		2																					
1628	1	"i think Òwinning the fight against poverty is achivible in our lifetimeÓ is achivible because in the article it says that they made amazing progress in just four year. an example of their progress in winning the fight agansit poverty is alot more people useing bed nest so not that many people die. another example is no school fees. because of that the attendince rate has gone up. they also surve lunch at school. and as for the hospitals, they have no fees, tretment to most diseases, and have running water plus electricty. the lastly farmmers have furtilizer for their crops. before those 4 years in 2002 the people in sauri, kenya did not have any of that. they only had about a dollor or less each day."	5	5		1																					
1630	1	"given the next 40 years, i believe that the goal can not be accomplished. i think they goal cannot be accomplished because what you have read in the beginning of project doesnÕt show what will happen in the future. just because the four years has shown much improvement, it does not neccessarily create a positive result in the end. as things get better in the area, many things will change, like population, food supply, school attendance, and it will create other problems and concerns. i believe that as time goes on, many problems will come between the project and it will not be as effective as in the four years so far described in the passage. in the passage, the author says that the attendance rate goes way up and the schools are free and have lunch provided. this can be very beneficial, but the problem with this is that with so many people in school, learning, getting paper, books, lunch, and whatever else, the schools would need to find a source to pay for these demands. the kids there are already poor and it is hard for any money to even go through into the community. though, many may pay for these funds from the project, the amount of money is limited and other problems may also arise. another concern that might occur would be the increase of population. as it is written by the author, the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. because of this, people living there have protection and more food to live and the population increases. because of the increase of population, more resources to sustain a life is demanded, which is hard to give. the district many not be ready enough to sustain a full population with their flimsy amount of resorces that they have. one final problem that may rise in the improvement of sauri, kenya may be government concerns. because of the new changes, the government will need to change and adapt to these new numbers in population/growth/economy/etc. as this goes on, not everything will be positive with changes that may affect the people, harmfully. this change can be very damaging could create a giant problem. overall, i believe that the goal can not be accomplished with the amount of time given. it is possible to get better as in economy-wise and population-wise but i believe that over time, the improvement will slow down, not giving enough time to finish the complete goal."	5	5		1																					
1631	1	"based on the article, ""a brighter future,"" i think ""winning the fight against poverty"" is achievable in our life time. in 2004, in the hospital there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. and there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital. kids can die from the malaria easily and adults get very sick. and in 2004 it's more better than 2004 the hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases, and it 2004, each bed net costs $5 but that time the people of sauri lived on less than $1 a day so the lived less than $20 a month. $5 a net is very expensive for them. that's so sad. and to 2004 many kids did not attend to school. because their parents could not get any more money for schools. in 2008, there are no-school fees and the schools now serves lunch for the students. so i believe ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life"	4	4		2																					
1633	1	"the author did convince me that, ""winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime"" because in the text i read that hospitals in sauri, kenya now have medicine to treat common illnesses, water, electricity, and its free of charge. this tells me that sauri now has better health, and there are probably fewer deaths. besides hospitals there are also changes happening in the villages. before many people were dying from malaria. now, bed nets cover every sleeping area, so the number of people who die from malaria have been reduced greatly. also, many more children now are getting education because it is free and the school now serves lunches. many people are also growing\producing more  food for their families because they have seeds, quality fertilizer, and now they have the proper tools to tend the crops they are growing. i think that the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya is helping lives and doing an incredible job in trying to abolish poverty. this article told\informed me about things that are being done to prevent a lot of crisis happening in sauri, africa."	4	4		3																					
1634	1	"the author had made me realize a lot of things in the story. one of the things were, to be greatful for what i have, and to appreciate life. i say this because, i know that i donÕt have everything but i have more than what the people did at the time. another reason is that those people didnÕt have docters to cure the diseseas that the had, but that makes me more appreciative that i can just go to a nearby hospital and get cured. one last reason is, the parents didnÕt have enough money to pay for school, but my mom dosenÕt have to she just buys paper, pencils, etc. i just think that the main perpose is that those people didnÕt have alot to brag about like we do so we just need to appreciate life, and everything that comes with it."	4	4		0																					
1635	1	"the author has convinced me that we could win the fight against poverty in this life time. we could win if everyone helps by donating . the millennium villages project is already fighting if we could help them then we will be able to win the fight. if we donate to people in poverty, they will be able to afford stuff they need, like, bed nets, water, and food. we can also help build better building for the people in poverty, for example, we should make bigger hospitals for them so they donÕt need to share beds. if we make bigger hospitals for people in poverty, they they wonÕt need to share beds. i wouldnÕt like to share a bed with someone if iÕm sick. people could also be trained in villages that are in poverty. they can be trained to be doctors so that there are more people to help treat people that are sick. we should help get bed nets for these people, so they donÕt need to buy it theirself. this can help save peopleÕs life. we can help farmers get their fertilizer, water and irrigation by just getting it for them. if we do this, they might be able to get it by theirself and feed their family. they can also help feed other families or even the whole village! this will help get better crops for people. farmers wonÕt be as worried about feeding their families or becoming hungry. student can also get midday meals. kids can also get to school if we help them pay. they will learn more and can help their village by working in it. they can get supplies they need. they would also help improve their village by using their knowledge. they will know what to do for their community in the future. i think that we can win the fight against poverty. we just need to help these people improve their self. i think they just need more knowledge. i think that we just need to donate and help."	5	5		1																					
1641	1	"yes i do think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. their are alot of different people who have overcome poverty. one of those groups is the well known africans. alot of africans have won against poverty by either donations, they did it by themselves, or they came to north america and brought back money or water for thier village. one of the three examples that support my answer is in the section named a better life 2008 they say in just four years they overcame poverty. the hospitals have electric generators, also there is no school fee and the school supplies food to the kids. lastly, there is a bed net in every tent. my second example is that also in the section named a better life Ð 2008 it shows the hospital has medicine free of charge. the hunger problem has been treated with fertilizer and seeds. but at first there was some people who werenÕt able to get medicine. also each bed net costs $5 my last example for supporting my answer is that there were dramatic changes in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa over a 4 year time limit. in the second paragraph of the section a better life they said if we all work together then we can overcome poverty. also in that paragraph the last sentence said that poverty is able to be overcome. lastly, it also says that there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. these are the reasons why it is possible to win against poverty. i hope that everything in the world would not have to suffer from the restraints and villainous wrath of poverty again. if we work together we can win against poverty. again these are the reasons i said yes to the questions."	4	4		3																					
1647	1	"yes, the author did convince me the ""winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime. i think the author convinced me because if sauri, kenya can be helped than so can any other place. for an example alot of kids did not go to school because their family could not afford the fee. now alot of kids can go to school because there is not any fee. also another example is that school now have lunch for the students. before the schools could not afford it. another is example is that now kids and adults will have a least chance of dieing, because medicine is now free of charge. i truly think that winning the fight against proverty for sauri, kenya is truly an insperation. some examples why is because this fight against poverty saved so many people lives in sauri. this fight gives people in other states and or countries that are fighting against  proverty some hope. my inspiration from this was because it shows that many people can come together and make a big difference. last i know that if we all work together we can end poverty for good!!!!!"	3	3		2																					
1650	1	"yes, i think the fight against poverty is possible if we put our minds to it. the people in kenya made it possible so we can too. we can fight against poverty, i know we can!!!! in the text it said that everyone has a net to protect themselves against mosquitoes. if they can provide for everyone to have a net, think about how much they could do!! also they have running water and electricity in the hospitals!! another example is, they provided food for the families by giving them fertilizer and seeds. think about how many lives they could save from starvation! so many people are saved just from the small things we give!! also the hospital give medicene - free of charge - for all of the most common diseases. look at what great act of kidness we have done for a small village. we could do much much more if we weren't at each others throat all the time. these are why i think its possible to end poverty. if we all pitch in we can make it possible! i know we can. instead of bombing iraq, and palestine, we can help them. we can end this."	4	4		1																					
1661	1	"i think that the against poverty achievable can change because many kids and adult are getting sick and the can afourd to get that much money. and they need help by getting money. the need food because kids and adult can die. they can really take the world togetherfor we can change property and they can change it for good. 3 is that they can get free food. 4 to get free education. and the world can the away the proverty and to have free thing for kids and people like water, food, shoes and nets for kids and people because the mosquitoes make kids die and people to be so sicl. and they did right by giving kids free food and now the the are more doctors for they can people. and they should make move beds for kids and adults in hospitals. thats the only thing i need to say!"	5	5		0																					
1664	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverty is very possible within our lifetime. it will be very difficult but i think that if we all work together we can do it! in 4 short years we have already seen the tremendous improvement in sauri's progress. they have made incredible achievements such as bring electrisity and water to the hospital. they also have medicine for all the common dieses in the hospital for free. this is very important because not now as many people die because of maleria and other curable desises. if the improvment rate keeps up sauri's hospitals will keep on improving with things like professional doctors, and more beds. so far they have made great progress with the hospitals. another great achievment sauri's made is the bed nets. now all sleeping sites in sauri have plenty of bed nets. with more bed nets it also means that less people are getting maleria and other harmful dieseses. sauri has also done a long way in the issue of hunger. we have provided more fertilizer and plenty of seeds for faming. with more fertilizer and water the seeds will thrive and less people will go hungry. they had made a huge improvement on these two very important issues in sauri. the last problem sauri was facing was the schools. they now have no fees so many people who could not afford it at first can now go to school. the attendance rate has come up a lot scince 2004. now the schools serve lunch during the day so kids have more energy to learn. the school still have a long way to go, they still need supplies and other things but they have made amazing progress. sauri has come such a long way scince 2004 that i belive it is possible to end poverty in our life time. i also think that if we all work together other places, not justsauri, could be out of poverty as well. lets work together to end poverty!!"	4	4		3																					
1665	1	"i think the author provided good info because the fight against proverty can still be won and achieveable in our lifetime. the fight aginst proverty can be won by people voteing and having enoughpeopole to vote with you and the goal may be reached by 2015 or 2025. in paragraph 8 it stated that many kids did not get to go to school because their parents could not afford to get them in school because people in sauri lived on less than $1 dollar a day. over 20,000 kids die from malaria because the medicine cost $5 dollars and their parents make less than $1 dollar a day so they do not have a lot of money to always get medicine. in 2004 schools had minimal supplies like books, paper, and pencils but the students wanted to learn. if we reach our goal against proverty. i think going against proverty is a good thing to do for 2015 or 2025. the reason i think going against proverty is good."	4	5		1																					
1668	1	"based on the article, i believe that the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime by all the examples that the author gave. one of the examples that was given in the article was when the author said ""malaria is one disease, common in africa, that is preventable and treatable"", it was disscusing how most hospitals were in bad conditions. also, now many children died because they weren't treated by doctors and how that could be prevented if there was doctors, water and electricity. another example that was given in the article was when the author said, ""many kids in sauri did not attend school,"" if children's parents weren't in poverty and if they served lunch at school, a lot more children would go to school and get and education so their lives would be easier. the last example that was given in the article was when it said ""we walked over to see the farmers. their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation"", if there was enough fertilizer and things to harvest the farmer's food then most of the crops wouldn't be dying. also, if farmers weren't in poverty and they at least had water to water their crops then they would have food to feed their families."	5	4		1																					
1669	1	"i think it is achieveable but very hard to do. this could be achievable because if one person can do it, someone else can achieve it. for example in the end, the yala sub district had medicine, free of charge, for all of the common diseases. this is good. they have this because some poor people canÕt afford it. this helps people that are sick and poor. another example is water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator of electricity. this helps alot to families that need stuff like water to make food. my final example is there are many soluteons to problems that keep people impoverished. that helps people that have problems and who are very poor. i believe it is possible winning the fight against poverty in a lifetime. this is for people that are poor: you should fight for things you want."	5	5		1																					
1676	1	"the author conviced me that winning against proverty is possible in our life time and here are a few examples to support this idea. one example is in least four years, citys could change and become a btter city. there was mosquitoes repelling bed nets in almost every house and the hospital treated alot of people who has common diseases. there is water and electrity in the hospital too. another example is that since 2004 to 2008, 80 villages across sub-saharan africa had changes and better living styles. my last example shows that the building cost least, for example, there were no more school fees and the medicene for the sickness is free of charge. the battles against proverty takes a long time but works so well because of the progress in africa. the difference between 2004 and 2008 was so huge, it surprised me. people were wearing dirty clothes, people could only use about $1 a day in 2004. in 2008, the city is like brand-new and everthing is better. there was good croops, and, people getting better fast. the kids were learning faster and had better clothes. these are examples that support my idea."	4	4		2																					
1677	1	"yes i do think the millennium villages project is achivable. i think so because in this text many kids, adults, and families are being helped. it says that 80 (eighty) villages across sub-saharan africa has had a dramatic change. the hospitals is one of the dramatic changes that occured. they now have medicane free for charge for the most common diseases. also they have an electricity genorator and water is also connected into the hospitals. schools now have midday meals in sauri, kenya and have extended the amount of school supplies for the students. the farmers now have a better fertilizer used for the plants they grow. last the beds, all the beds, in those 80 villages do have bed nets to keep malaria mosquitoes away so the people donÕt catch the disease."	5	5		1																					
1690	1	"yes, the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ as long as everyone works together, poverty can end. hospital rooms were packed with many kids and adults. many of the patients were unable to afford the treatment they needed. the hospital didnÕt have any doctors. many people that were in the hospital are there because of a disease in mosquitoes called malaria. these mosquitoes only come at night. a way to keep them away is to sleep in a bed net. a bed net has chemicals that lasts for 5 years. many farmers didnÕt have any fertilizer to help their crops grow. many farmers and families starve because of the lack of food that doesnÕt grow. schools do not have enough school supplies and school fees were too expensive for parents to afford. kids were unable to gain an education because of the chores they had  at home. if many people from around the world had helped end poverty, many people will have shelter, food and water, money, the treatment they need, fertilizer to help grow crops, bed nets, doctors, school supplies, and a good education."	4	5		3																					
1696	1	"i think the fight against proverty is not acheivable. she has not thought what happens when the population grows or what might happen when there government gots greed. the could also be possible disater, and we canÕt support afferica all the poverty happen in common cities in any country. each one of these reasons will prove the provity cant be end at all. i afrrica i notice all this poorness and sickness. we could help them to grow or get better. then sooner or later their population will grow out of control. its happening in most states/cities. when that happens jobs will be alot more scarce and poverty will once more rise. secondily, what will happen if the government start to think all this support food medicine could be sold for money that the could use. if the governors no good the econimy will colapase. we also donÕt know what happens if disaster strickes. that could ruin the project and we will be right back where we started. i also belive not every in the world would be a kind hearted to donate so much money every day to help the disater."	4	5		0																					
1699	1	yes the author did. at first the country of kenya was poor and the children died because they did not have medicine to get cured and did not have food or nets to prevent mosquitoe bites. now they have nets on every bed and medicine and they got fertilizer so now the kids can eat. and the kids were not able to go to school because of fees and they did not have running water or electricity and hospital workers now they have a generator hopsital workers and water conected to the hospital. that is how they fought poverty the went from poor and no supplies to everything they need.	4	4		2																					
1701	1	"the author convinced me that the fights is achievable because they are trying to assure the people in kenya health care and they are trying to help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in there communities, they are also gonna give them technical advice and practical items, such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies. also, they are trying to prevent malaria."	4	4		0																					
1705	1	"the author is tring to persuade other kids to help kenya by sending food, more clothes, and water. the first time the author went to kenya, she thought that it was scary. the people were poor, 20,000 kids died each day, and the people had no food or water. today, kenya is fourtunate, people have money, food, and water, and hospitals are even better than they were before the mellenium villeges project."	6	6		1																					
1707	1	"yes the author convinced me. the author convince because, in 2004 the people were living on 1$ a day and the sleeping nets cost 5$. but now 4 years later they all have sleep nets, where ever they are. there is medicine in the yala sub-district hospital free of charge, water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, aswell as the tools needed to maintain food supply. there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students. those are all of the ways the author has convinced me."	4	3		2																					
1714	1	"no, the author did not convince me that poverty could be beaten. yes, sauri was quite the accomplishment, but i believe poverty will always be there. in my opinion, someone will be under the influence of poorness, not everyone will be wealthy and have enough money for everything. i do think that getting more money and having progress in beating poverty is possible, i just don't think that helping everyone is possible. i say this because not everybody can have enough of everything."	3	3		0																					
1720	1	"yes why beacuse in better life said they got a hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases and water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricty in the hosptial and bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri and they got fertilizer for the seed for the can eat and they got school supply and they give lunch in the school."	5	6		1																					
1727	1	"yes, because there is people that can help your country and there is always a way to solve all problem, also some ways to help a country is to shorten prices of things, build more things that is needed, and try to fertilize more water and put a filter in all drains. one other thing is to clear rivers lakes, oceans and more. things i just wrote, are some things that africa have achieved already such as the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, for free charge, for all the most common diseases, water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity, bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri, there are no school fees, and the schools now serves lunch for the students, and the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. but they still need to add more jobs for parents to feed there children because there not going to keep giving things away for free."	5	5		1																					
1737	1	"no the author did not convince me because povererdy is not an easy thing to over come. if right now they are living on less than $1 a day then i donÕt think that they can over come that. how is kenya going to give them the money that they need to get started. in kenya they have about 20,000 people die from malaria every day. so they will need to put most of there money to there health ensurance. if people could not buy 5$ nets than i really cant believe that they will end the provicy. so thatÕs why i do not think that they will overcome the quality of there life."	4	4		0																					
1739	1	121601y2_00490350 winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime because all you have to do take the smaller things and find the problems and solutions. all you have to do is bet goals for millennium. for some examples like the yala sub-district hospital didnÕt have some of the treatment to give to the patient or the patients couldnÕt aford it. the most commons disease in africa is malaria and carryed by mosquitoes and to keep dragon mosquitoes away at night is a bed net to help when your sleeping and cost $5. the afect of the education for the children was hard for some to pay the fees and had no midday meal. the farmers need fertilizer because their crops were dying. if you look at this in away itÕs easy to take it by steps to make progress of solutions like connecting water to the hospital and fertilizer for the seeds and for the children to eat at school and school fees. this makes a difference to fight against poverty.	4	6		1																					
1746	1	"i think we can beat poverty in our lifetime because look how much we were able to change in 4 years because they were very poor people who were having very hard lives but we got them better schools, more food, better health care, and other supplies they really needed. if we keep this up and keep sending them supplies then they will be able to afford things they need and then they will be able to build buildings and get jobs make money and support there familys which would make there lives alot easier."	5	5		0																					
1752	1	the author convined me because he said that their hospital was in bad shape and 3 kidc were on a bed i think kids should not be dying for these diseases i think kids life should be saved and they said that the plant are dying and that is really bad and ever had she have school suplise and lunch and frunture.	4	5		1																					
1756	1	the resosn kids should know about the project is becaus so people around the world can help places that are in poverty get out of poverty. and the resons is place wantÕs the wame to happen to them like what happen to kenya with torend colths not water a lot of deseas and not that much food that what kneya was going through befor the porject now they have food hosptall to treat the desia and they have good crops for food and they have schools with lunch.	5	5		1

1762	1	"the author, hannah sachs has proven how poverty can be stopped. it take effort and determenation to strive on when you are in poverty. we should help them on the last stretch of their journey, to give them the nessesary materials to have as much money as an average american. there are many examples how we can help them. first of all, they need to live a healthy life. life in most places can be harsh, with a common disease or a virus spread from a certain area. this can be like in afria, where malaria is spread from mosquitoes. although the price to buy bed nets is very cheap, most people in many places have nothing to sell for money, and in poverty, you might usually have less than a dollar a day to live on. a quote to prove this is in the section Òthe fight for better healthÓ stating, Òeach net costs $5. second of all, places need food and water. many places might not have clean irragation and fertilizers to grow food. this is simple, yet places might have drought, and even have to live off some compost like orange peels. kenya in example has bad irragation and crops. in example, a quote would be, Òtheir crops were dying because they could not afford the nessasary fertilizer and irragation.Ó lastly, people need more education and knowledge. education is hard to get, as there are school fees and not all people have money. at home, kids did many chores, and had no time to be taught. people also did not know all the ways that people live easier, ways to make things better, and shortcuts to things. this makes life hard to live, with no ways and no time to do things in the little time you have. we could teach these kids, and it wouldnÕt hurt to give them money. all in all, people all over the world can besaved. this just takes us to give them a bit of money, and supplies. this simple way of giving to people can save thousands of lives."	4	4		2																					
1765	1	"yes because in the beging she was 12 years old and she helped fight for other things that those children needed like cloths, shelter, food, and education and in the text is says Òthe people were in povertyÓ and Òsome parents could not afford the school fees.Ó  and more are Òthere are know school fees.Ó since the school was that in the text it says agin in the text Òthe atendence rate went upÓ.  and this is why i think its over."	2	3		0																					
1770	1	"i think that it is possible to fight poverty. the author did convince me that it is possible to fight poverty but it is extremely expensive. the begginning ""the year was 2004."" the end ""the people of sauri had made amazing prohress in just 4 years."" 4 years is a long time to save only one village. in my opininion if every single righ person wasn't so stingy with their money they could defeat poverty in 20 years or so. ""the plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them acess to healthcare and help them stabalize economy and life in their communities."" i think if that idea was backed up by large funds we could beat poverty. first people would have to save all of the hospitals. ""three children to a bed and 2 adults to a bed."" the hospitals did'nt have electricity, water, or free medicine. i think this is a huge problem that has to be adressed. programmes like these are excellent because they save people in these villages so that we can defeat poverty. hospitals are important because in impoverished countrues the enviroment is one of the reasons that people are poor so they get sick quite a bit. i think that i can say that we will beat poverty. also this author did an excellent job of convincing me."	5	5		1																					
1771	1	based on what the author said i am convinced that we are able to stop poverty.  i am convinced because in sauri they stopped poverty they stopped it by using water in the sauri hostpitals this helped sauriÕs people survive diseases this is why i think we can stop poverty.  when i am old would be able to stop poverty in bad economies just as bad as sauri i will do this by having fundraisers and concerts.  to get food for the poeple in need i will make a big food drive with all sorts of fruit beans and other sorts of food.  for getting water will try to make a water system (filter connecting to a lake or river using donations/donation money.	4	4		0

All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that werenÕt to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this menÕs story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses.

The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight.

Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank Òwater feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.Ó The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,Ó is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."	3	2		3																					
6032	3	"The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left.

Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6037	3	"Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"	2	2		2

He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."	1	1		1

6054	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool.

6059	3	"The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, Òshort rolling hills,Ó and arround a,Òridiculously large snake,Ó and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting"	1	1		1																					
6060	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they canÕt just road.

6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ÓRough Road AheadÓ which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
6070	3	"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6073	3	"The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didnÕt see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didnÕt see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of WelchÕs factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."	2	1		2																					
6077	3	"The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isnÕt very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6080	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclistÕs ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it ÒOver on long, crippling hillÓ. The word ÒcripplingÒ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclistÕs ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding."	1	2		2																					
6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6083	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1		1																					
6086	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says Òthere was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didnÕt help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6090	3	"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."	1	1		1																					
6094	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."	1	1		1																					
6098	3	"The setting of the essay didnÕt really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, Òa ghost town.Ó @CAPS1 this couldnÕt have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is Òtraveling through the deserts of California in June.Ó Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."	3	2		3																					
6105	3	"In the stories, donÕt exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects.

This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt.

For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."	2	2		2																					
6140	3	"The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be.

His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but Òtumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.Ó He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left.

6489	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isnÕt any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay."	2	2		2																					
6500	3	"In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in."	2	1		2																					
6506	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1

He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, Ògot back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.Ó He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him."	2	2		2

Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says Ò@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states Òdimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.Ó @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes.

If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars.

Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclistÕs energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. ÒTrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.Ó This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat.

6566	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the ÒtownÓ The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ÒÉI noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, ÒGary and WilberÕs Fish campÉÓ (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   "	3	2		3																					
6568	3	"The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on.

6571	3	"In the essay, ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ ÒThe speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.Ó The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist.

Òa ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsÓ (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isnÕt an expert on snakes because he couldnÕt identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey."	3	2		3																					
6582	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2

Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply."	2	2		2																					
6594	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water.

Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him.

After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. HeÕs frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired.

Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
6746	3	"The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out."	1	1		1																					
6748	3	"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes heÕs experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old ÒcodgersÓ  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.Ó Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        "	3	2		3																					
6752	3	"The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So heÕs not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted."	2	2		2																					
6754	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldnÕt of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine."	1	1		1																					
6766	3	"The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was Ògoing to drop from heat exsostionÓ, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old ÒgentlemenÓ sitting on a porch."	1	1		1																					
6771	3	"In Joe KurmaskieÕs essay ÒRough Road Ahead,Ó the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the WelchÕs Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was ÒA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seenÓ (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey."	2	2		2																					
6773	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6781	3	"In the essay, ÒRough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,Ó the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. ÒBut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.Ó When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. ÒAfter I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMITÓ This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, heÕs relieved."	2	2		2																					
6782	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it.

But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe."	2	1		2																					
6793	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story ÒDo not exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1

6804	3	"Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in Òdo not exceed posted speed limit.Ó As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the authorÕs energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of Òdo not exceed posted speed limitÓ places the cyclist in a life threatening situation."	3	3		3

He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water.

By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage.

6848	3	"this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote Òabout forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first ÒtownÓ. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one timeÓ.

6854	3	"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey.

The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his Òwater bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsÓ (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."	2	2		2

His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..

Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldnÕt hold in the lamest made.

Being in that situation and setting I would have given up."	2	2		2																					
6879	3	"In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the Òghost townÓ that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him."	3	2		3																					
6896	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which donÕt even know the area anymore.

He starts out good, then comes to a ÒRough RoadÓ and he even says Òsometimes life can feel so cruelÓ.

Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says ÒI  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creulÓ. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6904	3	"ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from Òold timersÓ the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; thatÕs extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnÕt really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states Òflat road was replaced by short rolling hills.Ó He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnÕt help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnÕt have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "	3	3		3																					
6910	3	"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story ÒDo not exceed posted speed limitÓ by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, ÒI had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in JuneÓ(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ÒÉThe growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÓ(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."	2	2		2																					
6936	3	"In the essay, ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, ÒI  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.Ó In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."	1	2		2																					
6943	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6950	3	"The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble."	1	1		1																					
6957	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was Òtravelling through the high deserts of California in June.Ó This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the Òsandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,Ó which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
6958	3	"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also itÕs a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. ItÕs a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didnÕt take the old mans advice."	3	2		3																					
6963	3	"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."	1	2		2																					
6966	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  	1	1		1																					
6968	3	"The authorÕs setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclistÕs location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since heÕs traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a personÕs body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."	3	2		3																					
6971	3	"In the essay ÒRough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse.

This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. ÒThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindÓ (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6973	3	"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others.

Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp Ð If you want bait for the big ones, weÕve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again.

6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting.

These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1

Thes sight was troublingÓ, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, ÒThe sun was beginning to beat downÓ, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a ÒmodernizedÓ town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3

Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area.

7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water.

This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories.

The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture.

This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture.

They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1		1

All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnÕt hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasnÕt working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldnÕt cool down.

I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizonÓ The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumpsÓ This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he couldÕt drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the WelchÔs grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay ÒRough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the settingÕs features."	3	2		3																					
7205	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down.

Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time."	2	2		2																					
7219	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water.

In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,Ó by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip.

Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, ÒI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.Ó This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, ÒTo @CAPS2 a fireÓ where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him.

For example, in the short-story it says, Òover one long crippling hill, a building came into viewÓ This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. ÒThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.

The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who ÒhavenÕt left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.Ó The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting."	1	1		1

7330	3	"Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story."	1	2		2																					
7334	3	"The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So heÕs keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future."	1	1		1																					
7335	3	"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, ÒAbout forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first Ôtown.Õ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.Ó This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadnÕt seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."	3	3		3																					
7339	3	"The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ÓAt same point, tumple weed crossed my path.Ó This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest."	2	2		2																					
7340	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
7355	3	"The cyclist in ÒRough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ starts off in the Òserenity of an easly summer eveningÓ taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didnÕt mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his Òshort cutÓ was not so short after all. The Òhigh deserts of California in JuneÓ and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with Òno one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindÓ made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the heÕd be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a ÒWelchÕs Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.Ó @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.

7358	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation.

Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and heÕs out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, ÒI pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnÕt cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.Ó @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, Òyes- sir: I own a very good map.Ó @CAPS2 by this heÕs understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because heÕll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."	3	2		3																					
7367	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is.

7382	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.Ó This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it.

When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story."	1	1		1																					
7388	3	"Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice.

In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice.

For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found Òseveral rusty pumps,Ó and Òone ramshackle shed.Ó This probably didnt help him because he didnÕt have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldnÕt get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that ÒThere was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kindÓ and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldnÕt setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story ÒRough road aheadÓ the setting in the story didnÕt help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didnÕt help that he was in a desert."	3	3		3

Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit.

As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair.

When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desertÕs heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, Òwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.Ó If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, Ò I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. ÒAs this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance.

He pedals great distances trying to find ÒtownsÓ nearby. Once he finds them, they are either Òghost townsÓ or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says ÒAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeÉ blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.Ó @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all.

In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low.

3058	1	"i think the kids in the u.s.a. should be able to understand what life is like in kenya before and after the millennium villages, so the childeren of today will not be self centered and only care about the metiral things in life. the first example of life before the millennium villages is: the hospitals were not in very good shape. 3 kids to a bed 2 adults to a bed and 1 doctor running the hospital. the second example is: there was not alot of money to pay for school or school supplyes. there were littile or no school supplyes to teach the children with. the finalle example is: there were medicans that could coured but was to expensive. like 5 dollars was too expensive for some people. some people just had to die. the first example of life after the millennium villeges project is: most people in africa are impovised. most people can aford money for medicans alot of people do not die now. the second example is: most children go to school now. more children can become a doctor. the finalle example is: alot of people can buy the medicans that they need."	3	4		1	3	3	3																		
3060	1	"so people can know what it is having food and they dont get food. mosquitoes carry malaria and infect people by biting them. kids can die from it easily, adults get very sick. many kids did not attend school because their parent could not afford school fees. there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. the rooms were pack with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patiens could not afford it."	4	4		0	3	3	3

3246	1	"i is important for us to to know how kenya was before and after because us as kids today can help the other kids in kenya. we can help them by donateing money and toys for kids so they can have a simlare life to ares 2004: life in kenya was very poor and had lots of provety such as shereing bedÕs, no electrcty, no suplies and etc. life in kenya was tatterd because they did not have enoght money to by thing like bed nets medicane and other things. life in kenya had very much irrigation because they did not have pipes for running water to flow throw places. 2008: kenya to day have suplies they need and they have things they need to be helty and strong. to day in kenya the have running water and the have no school fees."	3	3		1	3	4	3																		
3253	1	"i think the millennium village project can achieve their goal which is to end poverty. the reason is that they already saved more than 80 villages. this shows that they supporters of the project worked really hard to save their community. it also shows that they have good unification. if there was disagreements and conflicts between communities, the project would have failed because they canÕt move forward. one example is in 2008, the yala sub-district hospital recieved medicines. then the hospital had medicines that are free of charge. this must have really helped thousands of people from common diseases because many people still only had a dollar a day. additionaly , the hospital got a water and electricity supply which is really important because water is neccesary to live. another example is when the project gave each person a bet net to avoid malaria. just by the nets, many people were saved while 20,000 kids died in the past by malaria. lasty a achievement is that the project provided each child the ability to learn in school with no fees. this should have made people knowlegable more than people that grew up in poverty. in conclusion, at the rate of the millennium villages projectÕs progress, i think they can fully acheive their goal as long as there is unification."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3259	1	"yes i think he did do good because its showing alot of stuff saying that how it is over there. i think he did good because he showed us how bad it was over there and how they would get paid $1 a day and that there was alot of mosqueties and how they carried alot of desieses and the will kill 20,000 kids a day. because the couldnÕt aford the tents that cost $5. because the worked for a dollar a day so they couldnÕt get it. i think that the author was good at this because he made it sound profecional and serious. and its good because it a verry serioes thing."	2	2		1	2	3	2																		
3260	1	"the author convinced that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. it it convinced me it was achievable because in 2004 the hosipatal was not in good shape. there was three kides to abed. also it was two adults to a bed. the rom was packed with patients who probably would not recive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. there was no doctor, only a clinical office running preventable disease people whoa re near death when they shouldnÕt have to be. there was no running water or electricity. mosquitos carry malaria. many kides in sauri did not attend school because there parents cant not afford them to go to schools. some kides needed to help with chores, like fetching water and wood."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3261	1	"the author convinced me. having no proverty is a good thing. people who is in proverty can have days that they need to struggle to survive. we humans need money to buy all our needs. food, shelter, clothes, and medicine. we need to pay for education for our kids. money lets us survive by getting all these things. in some parts of the world, thereÕs many places in proverty. children canÕt learn, people who are sick die fast, people starve, clothes are breezy providing no warmth for the body, and the buildings can be small. many people canÕt see whatÕs happening outside of our own world. ending proverty can stop people suffering days to continue. sauri, kenya, villagers only get $1 a day to buy little food and other needs. the sick people share beds leading people to get infected easily. children try to learn with little supplies, but donÕt eat providing no energy for the body. the hospital has limited amount of medicine. not much plants grow in the dessert and thereÕs no water. proverty can actually ruin many lives."	4	4		0	4	3	4																		
3263	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? do you think we can win against poverty? some people think it is totally possible, while others think there is just too much poverty. there are 6 billion people in the world and 50% live on $2.50 or less a day. i think there is too many people to get everyone out of poverty. there are a lot of people. there are around 6 billion people worldwide and more than 2.2 billion kids. 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 per day. there is too much people for us to help every-body. some people think that it could eventually happen, but i think it could not happen in our lifetime. maybe sometime in the future, it could happen though. there are also 115 million kids out of school. to help kids and adults, it would use a lot of resources. i donÕt think we have the power and the resources to help everybody. some people think that we can make a huge difference in every poor personÕs life. we can definately change some peopleÕs lives, but not everybodyÕs. some people think we can get everyone out of poverty in our lifetime. i disagree with this point of view because our lifetime is too short. we canÕt conjure up enough resources and money to help everyone in a short period of time. for example, it took 4 years to just get a small town of just 200-500 people out of poverty. even that took up a lot of energy and money. we can only make a difference in some peopleÕs lives. we canÕt get everyone out of poverty. there are too many people that need help. also, we donÕt have enough money, people, and resources to make huge differences. our lifetime is too short to change everyoneÕs lives, but we can start making changes. everyone can pitch in a little bit. that can help change lives. we can also help make people aware of these situations. some people donÕt know that there are people with no money out there. even though we canÕt change the world, we can take steps to change some lives."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3270	1	"no, because in the text it states, Ò20,000 kids die from the disease each day.Ó another statement that supports mine is the kids cannot concentrate because there is no food. also, the farmers were not able to farm because of the lack of fertilizer. one more fact is that the children would run bare foot in the ground, hurting their feet. but they are making it more and more possible to make it in a life time by  adding no school fees, providing lunch for the children, making attendence go up. they also have medicine at hospitals free, they supplied farmers with water and fertilizer, and the tools to farm the plants! they have improved 80 villages, and i think they might just make it to a lifetime, and they could get money to buy food and trade with other countries!"	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3271	1	"yes because in the article it said with the help of millennium villages they are getting to their goals and that tells me with other's i can reach my goal and fight against poverty and it also said that kids need more supplies for school so they can better and get to their goals in life. people also need more food and with the help they are getting they are getting more supplies and more food, thats giving them a better life. those examples convince me that in my life time winning the fight against poverty is achievable as long as you get the helps from othes and get the needs."	4	4		0	3	4	3																		
3275	1	"yes, because there is 80 villages in saharan africa where they have made it where kids at school get lunches everyday now. there is no fee for going to school. there is no money you have to pay for the hospital. there is runing water and electricity for hospitals. the author convinced me that winning the fight aganst poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	3	4		1	4	3	4																		
3279	1	"the author has convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is possible in our lifetime because 80 villages are already making progress. i think that many other villages will have help and not be impoverished again. also sauri has made a lot of progress already, so other villages can be helped too. another example is that the people of sauri made a lot of progress in just four years, so that proves other places in africa can be helped. the farmers of sauri already have more fertilizer and irrigation so they will have enough food and crops to feed their families. if people in the world worked together to provide water and fertilizer for these farmers, starvation can be prevented. i also think that other places can have lunches at schools if people would donate money to pay for them. kid can think better if they have lunches. another reason is that a lot of people suffer from diseases that can be prevented. the world should provide medicine that can treat these diseases."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3280	1	"i would say that the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable, in our lifetime because i think that if we try we will succeed, what i mean is if people start donating things like food, beverages, clean, uncontaminated water, clothing, medecines, money, shelters, and hospit. children that want tobe in school cant even go to school and kids that are in school have to walk 2-5 miles just to get their and they have little school supplies like books, writing utensils and paper and the children who would do anything to get an education get little or none at all. the hospital care is poor there is usually two adults to a bed and 3 kids to a bed. i think we can donate things like bread to fill them and clean water and things like misquito sorry because the levels of malaria is getting really high especially and not and tropical areas. we can also donate seeds to grow tomatos, lettuce, greens corn and more grains, also donating fertilizer because when they try to grow plants they die because there is nomoney for good fertilization. i think it would be good if people who sign up for millinium villages project should at least $2 dollars a day to help towards providing food, treatments and clean water."	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
3281	1	"having read this i have formed an oppinon. i believe that it is quit pissiable to fix the entire world, but in a date past 2025. one reason i think this is because when the author traveled to keny ait was a mess. school fees were to expensive for any one to actually pay, there was little water, and there were three kids to a bed in a hosbitale. and four years later it was much better, but still needed work. if it takes four-six years to fix one small village, it will take at least 10-100x time till we are done. but once we fix, we aren't done. villages, once in a while will need to be repaired. plus if they recieve 1$ income daily, they need more jobs so it's hard then it sounds. not only will they need more jobs, but villages that are in such wild and poor states as such will also need more hospitals. but if we do that we should also send medicine to them. because as the author stated where people would go to the hospital they might no get treated because either they couldn't afford it, or the hospital didn't have the right treatment. not only could they get sick, but they could also get attacked by a hippo, crocodile, or other wild creatures. so hospitals and income are important, in places like kenya. and it will take years to help these problems in only one village. imagine how long in would take in 300 villages! i have heard that some villages are'nt as ahead in history as us. some villages still have dirty water, or no toilets. it would take a while to make sure all villages have clean wwater, good fertalizer, and actual toilets. but it is important to do so because dirty water can sicken and kill people, and having no fertilizer will slow down how well and quickly your crop grows. i bet that some days people don't get fed. and if we are to help, it will take years to fix this. an example of this was in kenya where they don't have enough fertilizer."	4	4		2	3	3	3																		
3282	1	"yes, she convinced me because she did so much work thru out her life time because she took that goal from a young age and she has been acomplishing it. also because she knows what she wanted/wants and she is putting her heart and mind into it to get a sprout out of it. the reason why she convinced me is because she does it for the kids more than for herself. but mostly because she impoverished the land so more people can live, grow crops for food/vegetation. as well so the kids can live happily. what also convinced me was her quote Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó the reason why this convinced me was because throw out her lifetime she has got something out of it to make that sprout to turn into a tree and everytime she does something good that tree gives her fruit to eat so she wont starve. not just because of that also, she is doing what she enjoys best that is helping the people that are in need because they donÕt have anything to eat sometimes, donÕt have an education. they might not even have food or a roof to live on so they are always walking around naked or barefoot around the street. but mostly because they are millions of people out there that we donÕt know and are dieing of hunger, dieseases, coldness, or maybe even of love because they donÕt have any parents/family. but as well as food clothes and shelter, the people there are grateful for anything they can possibly get that we are not. so this really convinced me because it talks about how we can help other people but we just donÕt care or say we donÕt have time even thow we really do. this also inspired me to help when i can and i should do it to help people in need, because the need more things than what we have here in america"	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3283	1	i thinked it is achievable if you try. you can win against proverty if you have help and if you have trust. you have to trust the person who is helping you or you can't achieve.	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3287	1	"yes, winning the fight agaist poverty is achievable in our lifetime. one example is the making of the millennium villages project. they would not of made the project if they didn't think they could make a difference. they also would be wasting money. so they knew that they had a chance to make a differnce. another reason is that there dedicated to making success. they were determine because they actualy traveled to kenya to make a change. they helped and soothed the people there. financaly and emotionaly. if everyone did this ""poverty"" would not be a word. so if every other person helped there would be a better life for all. one last reason is that they made very good progress over the years in kenya. kids could go to school. there was electricity in the hospitals, there was water in the hospitals. common diseases were treated for free, and they had bednets. the poverty proplem had changed. every thing went well. so i think that winning the fight agaist poverty is possible in our lifetime. if everyone were to contribute things would be better. people would be healthier. lives would be changed. so there is no doubt that we are already winning."	3	3		2	4	4	4

3308	1	"i think she convinced me because she used alot of exampled and alot of detailed information. one thing she said was that the people of sauri were in poverty. they only had less than $1 to spend every day. thatÕs not alot of money to use. also, they said that in this hospital named the yala sub-district hospital didnÕt have water and electricity. there wasnÕt a single doctor there too. so, the patients werenÕt getting treated. it was either because the hospital didnÕt have it or the patients couldnÕt afford it. also, about 20,000 kids die of a disease called malaria that come from mosquito bites. people can prevent this disease from a bednet buy they cost $5. also, mosquitoes come out at nighttime, so theyÕd really help. she also said that farmer couldnÕt grow crops because theyÕd die of no fertilizer and water. next, she said that the schools charged fees. that caused many kids that couldnÕt afford school to not get education. but all of this changed in 4 years in the year of 2008. almost every place in sauri now had bednets. the schools didnÕt charge fees anymore, and now they had water and fertilizer to grow crops. in the hospital, they now have medicine, water, and electricity. i believe that sauri can achieved all their goals before 2015. i believe that their country can be like outs with money, food, and education!"	4	4		1	4	4	4

3363	1	yes the author did convice me that wining the fight against poverty is achievable because no one can really do that but if we all come together we can make that come true give them water give them electricity. they need life too. we all need to come together and give them money or they will keep dying. lets make a change in this world on the news we dont want to hear. people is dying. we want them to say people are not dying. these are example from the text: little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers back or running around in bare feet and tattered clothing. they have no doctor. when you go to the hospital three kids in a bed and two parents in a bed. only a clinical officer was running the hosptial. some parent can not afford school fees so the kid stay at home doing chores. give money to people you see laying out on the street they will be happy cause they dont really get nothing to eat they just be laying out on the street. when you give up feel happy and they will too. give hope to people.	2	2		1	1	2	1

3381	1	the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime because it might take some time to get it done but we still can work together to get something done for the people in sauri so they can get better and not live in poverty. an example would be when hannah sachs said Òthe goals are suppose to be met by 2015. the goal is already half way done. they achived most of by 4 years and its not even close to 2015 the author said Òthey was 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed.Ó the mosquitoes their carry malaria and most of the people their cannot afford a net to protect them from bugs. and they can catch malaria the people cannot afford nets so thats why we as america have to help sauri.	3	4		1	3	3	3																		
3384	1	"it is important for the people in the united states to know how life was before and after the millennium project to show how appicitive you should be for the stuff you have in the world because some people dont have it. also that if something is not going right dont give up keep trying because some amazing things can happen. befor the millennium villages project some tarible things were going on, in the hospitle there were 3 kids in a bed and 2 adults in a bed, the rooms were packed with people who would most likely not get treatment, there was no water or electricity, the farmers crops was dying becaus they could not afford fertilizer, and the school had very little supplys and no food. but after 4 years there was a big change. the water was connected to hospitles, all most all medicen is free, bed net are used in every sleeping site, schools are free, theres no more starvation, dramatic changes occured in over 80 villages accros sub-saharan africa. im so proud."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3386	1	"what i say is Òwinning the fight against poverty is a achievableÓ is going to work. cause their kids that can fight for it or not but they tried to. 1 example is sence they have like no school, no real doctor no home and no money. other example they get a diesece that killed kids and adult get very sick. 3third example some places were they are may not be or have water or electricity. but what they do is they try doing things so nothing will happen to them. and try to go to school that some place that they do not have school and some do but canÕt pay it."	4	4		1	3	4	3																		
3396	1	she is trying to prove that they can end poverty because she is using some of her money to buy bed nets and trying to get enough money to buy medicines for hospitals. she said that she would get medicines to cure a disease called malaria. malaria is a disease caused by mosquitoes that usually fly around at night. she went to some schools and saw that they donÕt get lunch and some children get sick from not eating. the farmers plant as many crops as they can so that they can feed their whole family and sometimes they worry that they donÕt have enough fertilizer and soil to grow crops for their families. when she went to see the hospital she realized that their were no lights or electricity. so she couldnÕt see the inside of it to explore it. another problem with the hospital is that there is only one clinic officer running the hospital and their were no doctors . dramatic changes have have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging  to supporters of the millennium villages project. there are many solutions to problems that keep people impoverished. what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good. it will not be an easy task. but sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime.	3	4		1	3	3	3																		
3399	1	"i would say yes, because the sauri village achieved a lot in 4 years. even though i think they will achieve their goal, i think itÕll take more than 11 years. maybe theyÕll be finished by 2017. to support my answer, here are some examples. first, the hospital now have free medicine formost of the common diseases in africa. second, every sleeping sites now have bed nets to prevent mosquitoes from spreading malaria. third, the hunger crisis were solved by the un providing the village water, fertilizers, and even tools for growing and maintaining crops. lastly, since school are now free and kids gets lunch too, attendance rate went up. now, a lot of kids go to school. i think the millenium villages is possible, but i think itÕll take until 2016 or 2017 to achieve their goal."	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3402	1	"yes the author convince me by showing in 2004 they were running out of school suplies and they couldn't eat lunch but 4 years later they had a bunch of school suplies and they could afford a mid-day meal. in 2004 the hospital had 3 children and 2 adults per bed and couldn't afford medicine but now they can afford medicines and if it common diseases are free. also they also only had 2 kids per bed and 1 adult per bed. now bed nets are used in every bed site in sauri and water is connected to a hospital and they are also have a generator. also the hunger crisis is over it has been adressed with seeds, and the tools that need to grow the seeds."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3406	1	"poverty is hard to end but i think mabey when iÕm older it will change. i honestly think that poverty wont end but it wont last either, what im saying is that theres poverty everywhere nomatter where you are and there is not enough money in the world to end poverty, but poverty doesnt have to be forever it can be temporary. like private schools dont need to be paid for or more scholarships for kids with less money. students should be able to show their talent or how smart they are and get a scholarship. thats what i think the school district should do if the poverty increases because of school fees. another idea i have to stop poverty is that the government should provide more healthcare thats cheaper so people dont have to pay so much for their family members not to die. i also think they should create shelters that help homeless people get back on their feet and get a job and if they have a drinking problem mabey help them get rid of their problem."	4	3		0	4	4	4																		
3410	1	133501f11_000531782 we can win against poverty if people tryied hard enogh then people could help other people who are in poverty by trying to raise money for them or build stuff for them maybe make beds with built in net or a hospital with docters and more beds or help build something that will help people get water more ensuliy more-technology and more school supplyies or more regular sulapplyies.	3	3		0	2	2	2																		
3412	1	"yes the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime. she convinced me because of how she do mvp (millenium villages project) are working together, and have brought clean water to hospitals also the hospitals are also supplied wuth electricity, also the hospitals give medicine free of charge to common diseases. also they have grown in food supply, and the kids finally can have a midday lunch, also theyÕve been able to keep to keep the food supply. also the native africans can finally have a bednest to protect them from the malaria infected mosquitoes and stay alive. so after all the change is sauri, kenya has gone well so far step by step."	4	4		2	3	3	3																		
3413	1	"well, poverty is bad. i donÕt like poverty. poverty is like something bad in life. i want to go to sauri, kenya to help the people that lives there to have a better life. i might even bring some things that will help them, that is, if i ever go there. sauri, kenya is a small country in africa. as a kid, i have always enjoyed helping people in need. like if i see a homeless, i want to help, but whenever i do, i never have any change on me. so, one day, when i grow up, i want to go to places where children need help, or is in need. and, well, alot of people say i am a very nice person cause i like to do these things. one day, i want to visit sauri, kenya and help the needy. i have heard alot about starving children in africa. whenever i heard anything about africa, i get all said. i really do feel bad for the needy children. some kids donÕt even have enough money too go to school. and, some donÕt even have enough to have a real meal. so, once i grow up, i will try to have a good job, earn enough money and get tickets to africa! i belive that if i keep my grades up, i will indeed have enough wealth to get tickets to africa. cause, i have heard the tickets to other places that isnÕt in the usa, like europe, china (asia), south america, e.t.c., are very expensive. and, now, just talking about this, makes me even more exited to go to africa; sauri, kenya. it sounds very exiting! i hope that i will suceed this goal when i grow up. but first, i will need to finish college. school is still very important. you need to keep your grades up to have a bright future, you know? so, yes, sauriÕs poverty/progress shows us that it is true that we can achieve poverty in sauri, kenya!!"	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3420	1	"yes hannah sachs did convince me that winning against poverty.  in 2004 it was hard to get bed netÕs because people earned $1 a day.  but the bed netÕs are $5.  also the mosquitoes would bite the people at night.  children can die easily.  20,000 kids get killed every day.  in 2008 almost everybody has a bed net.  also they have more medicane to treat the disease.  in 2004 the hospitals they did not have any lightÕs and water.  they also did not have lotÕs of medicanes.  but in 2008 now they have lots of medicanes that treat almost every disease.  they also have electricty and water.  in 2004 the farmerÕs did not have lotÕs of crops because they did not the water they needed to plant the crops so they can eat the food they grow or to sell to other people.  in 2004 kids could not attend school because the fee was so expensive.  also the kids that could go to school they did not have lunch at school so when they worked they lost their energy.  in 2008 they did not have any school feeÕs so their lotÕs of kids going to school.  also they need lunch at school so kids heed enough energy."	4	3		3	3	3	3																		
3424	1	"the author did convince me that the war against poverty is acheivable. when it said that there was no water, electricity, doctors, and many patients with horrible conditions werenÕt attended to, i thought there would be no hope. even when they said that the farms there provided no food i thought there was no hope. but then i thought that with the millennium village project they could be recovered. in just four years they have made much progress which tells me that they have lots of hope for the future. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all the most common diseases. water is now connected to the hospital, which also now has a generator for electricity. bed nets are now used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no school fees and the schools now serve lunch for students. the attendence rate has highly shot up. dramatic changes have happened 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. not everyone has been releived from poverty, but if they did this for kenya they casn surely acheive the win against poverty in years to come. winning the war for poverty isnÕt just helping everyone get rich. this is about making a diffrence. making towns sparkle again. them being on the top ten best places to visit. winning the war for poverty is winning the war for the world."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3425	1	yes it's worth the fight because the plain in the story is to get the people out of poverty. and poverty is like poor: have a little money our no money. for example: sauri have a little money thatÕs poverty. my opinion is to make poverty to stop and help or get everyone in the world to help or work together. now sauri made a different to some people life so can we if every one put there mind to the task we can make a different to like sauri. for example if sauri came together with people and mad them stronger she just did impoverished. the fight for better health there was a lot of some people was not treated thatÕs sad. and the author convince me by you can make a better life for other if you tried. i infer that if people try they can make a diffrent.	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3440	1	"i belive the author thinks that because; alot of kids are really not thinking about what other people go through. some are more so ÒmaterialisticÓ weaning only cares about material things; such as play stations, t.v., internet and such. and life in kenya was hard and poverted, so kids there were not able to have such electronics, and wanted itemÕs that are not actually needed. you never know you and your family can be in poverty at any time. millenium villages projectÓ helped people of kenya stop struggling tring to get by each day. (it was very difficult to surive) but now, after the Òm.v.p.Ó the lives of whom live in kenya got better, but slowly got better (their lives got easier). for example: before the Òm.v.pÓ, children and adults had many medical problems either because they had no money to pay for what was needed. or two, the hospital did not suply the right treatment. now medicine is free of charge, water is available to hospitals, as well as electricity. before, bed nets were not availible.  now they are. back then, were many hunger crisis, and now is pervented because of fertilizer and seeds, and now feed lunch to children in school, which has no fees, and has enough school supply for every one. in closing: you never, ever know what could happen to you and your love ones. if you are wealthy now, you never know, you can end up in poverty just like those in kenya ÒwereÓ. Òalways be mindfull and never be forgetfullÓ. never forget that you could end up the exactly the opposite of what you are now. (you might be rich and able to afford anything you want, or dont have to struggle at all now, but then for what ever reason you go broke cant afford to go to school, go hungry, ect.) thatÕs why you must always be mindfull to whats around you, and never be selfsentered, materialistic, spoiled, ect. never think nothing can happen to you because it can. learn how to live without materials that waste your time when you can be apreciating it."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3442	1	"i agree that poverty should be eliminated because people would have no food and water, electricity and you nowhere to sleep. in africa 20,000 people die everyday. till this day, a lot of people die from maleria but in africa 20,000 people die, even little kids die. for example ""their crops were dying because they could not afford the neccesary fertilizer and irrigation the first reason"	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3456	1	"yes we can stop poverty in our life time. poverty is a thing we all go throught in life so if the millennium village project did not help proved better medical care for the sauri people, they would have died. even though the millennium village project helped the sauri people. i could tell that it was hard to get all the money they needed to help develop saur. for example they needed they needed lot of donation, doctors to help treat the patients, volonteers to organiz and help do thing for the people. we our selfs can help the people by donating clothing, sending food, making a funrazer to help rais money for the sauri pople and help sponsor children to go to school. the millennium village project helped the sauri people do many things possible like for example now the children can go to school, farmer donÕt need to worry about what they need to feed tehir family and pateints who are sick do not need to worry about pay to get treatmeat. i think that the sauri people are luck that people help and care people for them when they have a bad crises."	3	3		2	3	3	3																		
3485	1	"the author did convince  me that we can win the fight against poverty because if the millennium villages project can make a difference in sauri in 4 years then we all can make a difference in the entire country of kenya or in the entire continent of africa in 9 or 10 years. the author also convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty because she said that there were small things we can do like give $5 to buy a bednet, donate medicine, or give gardening tools that could save thousands of lives. finally, the author convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty because she was 12 years old and she made a huge difference. this shows that no matter how old you are you can make a difference."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3488	1	"i think the aurthor thinks its important for us to learn about kenya to show us how we can change the world and what the effect would be like. the millennium villages were poor and didnt have enough money to pay for medicine, to get fertilizer for crops to eat, and for schools. over 20,000 kids died a day because of the proverty in kenya. the hospitals didnt have water, electricity or doctors. the kids had to share a bed. there was three kids to a bed, and two adults to a bed. when the project ended kenya had medicines for the hospital the kids were able to go to school, they had food because they now had fertilizer for their crops. now kenyas kids are starting to feel better now that they have medicine for when they get sick."	3	3		2	2	2	2																		
3490	1	"i firmly beleive that kenya should had gotten more help. the reason for me stating this is because, the people of kenya got what they wanted, but the thing that they didnÕt, were shoes. also, i think that the govermnrment should have gave them more money in the first place. in my opinion, i think that people should have made a strong repelent for house, and not just the bed i think that the reason why the misquitos keep coming in, is because, they donÕt know a way to stop them. but overall what they had done to make kenya a better place, i think that they did a great job with the inprovement in kenya. in my opinion, the title states that kenya is making life better there. the evidence in the text shows that the people of kenya wants to have more growth in the year of 2015. at the time when kenya did not have alot of books for school, i didnÕt think it was good because, when children donÕt have enough book to learn, they wonÕt a really good education as they should. but in 2008 everything inproved because at first, kenya would drink from unsafe water, and now kenya drinks from safe and clean water well. also, at first kenya did not have as much hospital beds, and know they have enough money to get new hospital beds, and know they have enough money to get new hospital beds, and they do. and now kenya has enough books, and now they can get a real education. also, kenya could not get food during school because they couldnÕt aford it, but only the lucky ones would get lunch, and the children would only get water while learning, but now they have enough food for every child inschool. the town of kenya has become better and better througout the years. but kenya is hoping to reach their goal in 2015. from whats been happening througout the years, i truely think that kenya is going to reach their goal. do you think that kenya is going reach their goal? in the article, it states that kenya has changed througout the year. in 2004, we followed the village leaders into yala sub-district hospital. it was not in good shape. there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. also, during 2004, the hospital had no electricity and they had no medicine. but in 2008, the hospital became better, now in 2008, the hospital now had electricity and more medcine to treat patients in the hospital. also, they got more hospital beds so people would not have to share hospital beds. dramatic changes had ecoured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages project. i feel this way because i know that everybody could pitch in and give someone a better life in kenya."	4	4		3	3	4	3																		
3503	1	"ÒyesÓ it is because if they can improve all of that in four years imagin what they can do in four more years. they could make a school or even make a city you never know what can happe. the paragraph that mostley made me say yes is the last one about having a better life and now they but electricity, water & medication that there is no fee and most importantly they give more food at lunch time & four years ago they (people) dident get food at lunch time. thats a really big acomplishments in four years. i think they could make cloth for children in four more years of hard work so by the time that im 95 & really old they are already impoverished and can make into a city."	3	3		2	3	3	3																		
3505	1	"yes, she did convince me that we can win the war against poverty in our lifetime. one of the most convincing things was when she told us how much progress sauri had mad in so little time, like how they got fertilizer and seeds for the farmers. they got water and electricity to the hospitals, better doctors and bednets. after i heard how sauri was in such a bad state i was sure the u.n. would put a lot of time into their millenium villages project."	3	3		0	2	3	2																		
3506	1	"the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is achevable in our lifetime the convince me because everything in life is possible you just have to set your mine to do it. also he gave examples of how he was going to do it. i think it would be hard to fight against proverty because of all the people that are being affected by it. some examples the author gave were giving out school supply, providing shelter, water, and food. the hospital was giving out free medicine, water is finally connected to the hospital the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, there are no school fees, school serves lunch for schools now, bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages project. there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. what it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty stricken areas for good. it will not be a easy task to end proverty. but sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. thats why i think the author gave a convincing speech about the fight against proverty being achevable in our lifetime. he gave good reasons about this situation and he made the article more interesting."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3509	1	"in my opinion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. people already spent 4 years helping, and itÕs already working! thereÕs more medication, fertilizer, schools with no fees, and much more! if these are the things we accomplished in four years, imagine the things we could do in 10 years if we keep trying! hospitals have free medication for people with common diseases. before, they didnÕt have this, and you had to pay for it, or youÕll just basically stay sick! now, people donÕt have to stay ill, and just go on with their lives that they deserve. people with malaria can be treated, and it can be prevented with bed nets. as for schools, parents donÕt have to pay money for their kids to have an education, and a bright future. they even serve lunches so kids wonÕt have to starve after school. this proves that if the world works hard, and works together, there is a lot of progress that can be made. if we actually try we could change a lot of things in this world, and make it better."	5	4		3	4	4	4																		
3513	1	"yes and no, if you ask me. i feel that  you could do this in major sets. the intensification, however makes it seem as if this is not possible (deep down, it is.) because feeungs and experiences, i feel it can be changed (whenever) we can make it. 4 the context was good, but are you talking about an internet war, a real war, an inter-context war or the collapseÓ? and when can we unite, against what? in Òa better life-2008Ó they had made immense progress, which can state back to zone. the pevepty is important to everyone, however. this could be amazing-will it be epic, or sad? what is there to do? can we save ourselves from this? earn power, wealth, and happiness. can it happen, and when? do we do it, or not and head for the future. whateverÉ"	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3514	1	"i think based on this article winning the fight against proverty is acheviable because in the subheading Ò a better life- 2008 Ò she said that in the last past four years they made a lot of progress like now they have medicine, water, electricity, and bed nets for the hospitals and homes. they also addressed the hunger and they now have fertilizer and seeds also they have tools that maintain the food supply. now in their school they donÕt have any fees they also serve school lunches for the students. when they have school all the children come so theyÕre attendance rates go way up. theyÕre changes occurred in 80 villages across the sub-saharan in africa where their progress is to encourage supporters  of the millennium villages project. so now what i think is that the people of the 21st century can end proverty within a couple or few years."	4	4		2	3	3	3																		
3515	1	"yes because after 4 years the people of sauri had made amazing progress. i also found that the yala sub disctrict hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common disease. also that i think yes is because water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. finally i think yes because the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3524	1	no because if i fight a guy who is poverty that will be wrong because i can hurt him self. for example if i hit him he is weak and he will go down. a impoverished is someone rich than a poverty. in kenya they have diseases that can not be cured. i infer poverty people need money. i also think impoverish better than poverty. no because if i fight with a poverty it will be bad because they are poor. poverty is not achievable because someone can get hurt. for example if i was a impoverished and i fight with a poverty i would because a impoverished is stronger. if i fight with a poverty again he could he would go wild because he know that i beat him. i the text it states that they plan to get people out of poverty. they will help them stabilize economy and quality of life in their communities. the villages project was created to help. a poverty is someone poor having little or no money. i infer someone should help the people that are poverty. i also think that poverty need health care.	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3525	1	yes winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.  in this story a girl whent a a village in africa.  she visted a hospital there to find out that there was no water or electricty and that there where three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed.  she also whent to a farm that had no crops because of no water and fertilizer.  in the end the village got bed net for the people and also gave water to the hospital that gerated electricty.  they also gave water and fertilizer to the farm.  in paragraph 10 the first sentence it said Òdramatic change have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.  also in paragraph 10 it said Òthere are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished.  also in paragraph 10 the 4 sentence it said Òwhat it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken area for good.	3	3		1	3	3	3

3574	1	"based on the article, i am convinced that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in my lifetime.Ó  in 2004 poverty was very high in africa.  the hospitals had little medicine and few hospital beds.  there werenÕt doctors there and treatment was expensive.  school had little supplies, didnÕt serve lunch, and had high fees.  farmers couldnÕt grow crops because they couldnÕt afford the necessary fertilizer.  just four years later in 2008 the poverty rate decreased by alot.  the hospitals were full of medicine that was free.  more beds were available.  schools had lunch served and attendance is free.  farmers were given fertilizer, seeds, and tools to grow crops.  hospitals also had electricity and water.  although africa isnÕt the only place in poverty, the way poverty was extinguished there it wonÕt be long for other places to."	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3577	1	"yes, the author did convince me that beating poverty is possible in our lifetime, because in only four years the mellinnium project has, provided bed nets, water, fertilizer, school supplies, and education. to start off the author said bed nets can save lives, are only five dollars, but yet 20,000 people still die from malaria. that set the scene of how poverty stricken sauri really is. that is why i am amazed that now every sleeping sight now has bed nets, in only four years. so that tells me that itÕs possible to make poverty a thing of the past. second, the millennium project has given all farmers water, seeds, and fertilizer. and just four years before they had to worry about keeping up their families. in 2008 they are safe and secure, knowing that their crops will grow. lastly, the millennium project has allowed all students to go to school, beacause itÕs free. also, they gave the schools books to the schools which gave the children a better chance to learn. plus, they now have lunch to give them energy for the rest of the day. need i remind you this all happened in four years. so, as you can see the author was very pusuasuve, and convinced me that we can win the fight against poverty, beacause ever since the author went to sauri in 2004, alot of changes happened. like, they now have water, fertilizer bed nets, school supplies, lunch, and a better education."	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3580	1	yes the aruthor did convince that winning the fight against poverty was achievable in our life time by her  telling me that in just  4 years a great progress. also if something like this happens and she can do  something about it i am pretty  sure that the poverty is achivable. so it seem like it was never hard to make a difference.	3	3		0	2	3	2																		
3586	1	"iÕm going to write about how poverty will end in kenya. they gave water to help with all the sick people. they have a generator to use the technology to help out a ill person. they also had tools to help farming and to build mo things to live by. they have fertilizer and seeds to help farming going and take away all the hungry people. they also get to go to school for their education. at the school they provided school lunch and the supplies they need, they gave medicine to help all the ill people in the hosptial. it is also free of charge, so they donÕt have to worry about money. they have bed nets to keep mosquitos away, to not get sick. i strongly think that poverty will end in lveng"	3	3		2	3	3	3

3591	1	i feel that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. (1) example is the plan is to get people out of poverty the goals are supposed to be met by 2015.# (2) example is some other targets are set by 2015. the last example is the whole thing starte in 2004 they are trying to make it by 2025. the whole point of this article is about poverty. the girl went to kenya in 20004 and she was only 12 years old.	3	4		0	4	4	4																		
3592	1	yes she convinced me because she said that yala sub district hospital was not in good shape and did not have medicine. they did not have shelter to live on. she said kids run around bare foot. she also convinced me because she said that bed nets are in every sleeping site in sauri. they dont have to go to pay to go to to school and it serves lunch. there we geeting better but she convinced me that they need more help by donating 5$ or 1$.	3	3		1	3	3	3

3609	1	"yes, she made a convincing argument because this argument says in 2004 in the hospitals of sauri, kenya there was not water, electricity, and people couldn't afford the medicines that they needed but in 2008, because of the millennium villages project, the hospitals have free medicines for the most common diseases, water, and a water generator for electricity. also, in 2004 thousands of people dies from malaria because they couldn't afford vaccines for it or the bed nets to protect them while they are sleeping but in 2008, bed nets were used in every sleeping site in sauri. another example, is in 2004 farmers' crops died because they could not afford the fertilizer and irrigation needed and a family would plants seeds in result of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. in 2008 fertilizer, seeds, and tools needed to maintain the food supply were sent to farmers and familys in sauri. this is why i believe winning the fight against poverty is achievable in this lifetime."	4	4		2	4	4	4

3647	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life,"" because she told us what was going on in sauri, kenya. she talked about how little kids were wrapped in tattered clothing. and how mothers had to sit on the dusty ground and sell bananas just to make money. then she talked about the millennium, villages project (mvp). and how this project would help people in poverty. she said the goal was to help people in poverty. so they could get the help they needed. the plan was to help get people out of poverty, to assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quilty of life in their communities. the mvp will help villages to get technical adive and practical items like fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. the mvp hope to reach their goal by 2015, but some say they might reach their goal by 2025. the author also convinced me by telling me what was decreasing their population. such as mosquitos that carry malaria. and how they can kill you when they bite you. and how they only come out at night, so they can kill you in your sleep. i was also convinced when she said that they couldn't afford a $5 bed net, but the mvp tires to keep them alive. but i was mostly convinced when she said in just fours years (2004-2008) things started getting better. they cured lots of people, and the population increased by alot. and 80 villages recovered. and that's how the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ï"	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3650	1	yes i agree with it because if you stop a whole state from poverty that is a great achiement you will remember for the rest of your life. you might even get the noble peace prize. you will be rewarded with fame and wealth and you will be knowen every where. then they will want you to do the contries that has poverty dieses and etc. a bad place to live hot enough food not enough water to drink and not that much clothes and shoes to wear.	4	5		0	4	4	4																		
3653	1	"i think we can fight poverty if everyone pitches in to help. if the millennium project can do it, other people can help too. people who support the millenium project helped make a difference. they helped end hunger and poverty. they also helped schools and hospitals. they gave medicine free of charge for the common diseases there. water and electricity is not connected in the hospital. there are no more school fees and the students have lunch. they have also given tools and fertilizers to plant new crops. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. if they can do all this, then i think we can prevent poverty. we just have to work together with the help of friends and family."	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3657	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. however, it will come with many challenges and difficulties. one example of why i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that we helped the people of sauri with many things. we gave the fertilizer, seeds, food, medicines, and a lot more. however, it is very expensive. there are millions of people who are poor and need help so i also think that this is not achievable. but if everyone helped, i think it will be achievable."	4	5		1	4	4	4																		
3676	1	"the author thinks that children in the u.s should learn about how their life was before the millenium villages project before and after. she wanted us to learn and know how hard their lives were and how they had to live with what they had. their lives were in constant danger before the millenium villages project. for example there children were dying everyday because of mosquitoes carring malaria. this was be cause they couldnÕt afford to get bed nets or have enough money to afford the right treatment there child needed. another example is that when the children went to school the didnÕt get lunch because they couldnÕt afford to feed them a midday meal. thatÕs how rough their their lives were and how poor they were. after the millennium villages project there life wasnÕt so hard because there hospital has the medicines they need, running water, and a generator for the electricity. now the schools are serving lunch for the children. for example now when the children go to school they get lunch so now they are most likely focusing more and doing better. another example is when they go to the hospital they have water, electricity, and medicines so now they wonÕt be there in the dark with no water and not many medicines. i infer that life is not as hard and they are not having as many problems in kenya."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3680	1	"yes, she did because i do belive winning the fight against poverty is achievable because they are increasing their steps to get rid of poverty. for example they let hospitals charges be free of its a common disease. they let schoold be free of charge and they serve meals. finally they also have no elctricy, lack of water, you had to pay for school, everything in the hospital you had to pay, you had to buy bed nets, and they didn't even serve lunch at school. but once again they have improved in all those things. sauri is at least now a better place. she also convinced me that other countries might gorn in and help sauri. she also made me feel lucky that i am living better than how those people on sauri lives."	3	3		2	3	4	3																		
3683	1	"the author convinced me because it is wrong that young children have to live of $1 a day, and the have nothing to eat. also the kids can eat at school and have more energy to focus and get a better education. the parents can provide bedsheets so them and their kids so they can't get sick."	4	4		0	4	4	4

3707	1	"Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ as the author put it, is achieveable but not in our lifetime. it could be in our childrensÕ lifetime or the lifetime of earth itself. i say this because the year weÕre in now, 2012, and 2015, the year in which the goals are supposed to be met, is only three years away. when the author wrote Òwinning the fight against poverty in our lifetime,Ó did she mean the poverty only in kenya, africa or the countries that are in poverty all over the world? if she was just writing about kenya, africa, then yes, i believe that the goals will be met by 2015 or so, because supposedly Òdramatic changes has occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa,Ó and hopefully by now, better/more changes have occurred since 2008. now, if she meant the whole world will no longer have poverty, then thatÕs a bit exaggerated, but the united nations can try to Òmake the world a better place,Ó but donÕt try too hard so that youÕll need to add taxes to people Ôcause youÕre running out of money. good luck!"	5	5		1	4	4	4

3723	1	"well, the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achieable in our lifeÓ because in africa children got sick and died, children where young and they needed the bed nets. they needed food but they did not have that much in farms, the crops where dieing. they couldÕt afford the right fertilizer. i think that is why they need to Òfight against poverty is achieable in our lifeÓ when people had a chance to go to school and learn like us right know, in africa they couldÕt because there was minimum supplies like books, paper, pencils, they had that but did not get to learn. that is why they have the right to fight against poverty is achieable in our lifeÓ. last but not least the last example of why they should fight against poverty is the adults and children got bitten by mosquitos that killd them the chemicals in their body. 20,000 people died from the mosquito bites. i think after they changed every thing and they have bednets they should be better."	5	5		2	4	3	4																		
3726	1	"the author wants us to see that we have things that kids in kenya would be happy with. hannah sachs is bring us a message to be happy at stop asking for more things. in 2004 i see that kenya was not a good place for the people to be at that time cause if they went to the hospitals they would die. at the hospital the treatment need money and people had to share beds 2-3 people where in a bed, no doctors, no water, no medicines no electricity. people in the hospitals would die by a diesase called malarie. people where hungry, farms had no water & fertilizer, no meals at school, no school supplies, crops were dying. but now the hospitals have doctors, water, mediance electricity, bed nets. schools serve meals, no school fees, attendce is up at schools. farmers have tools, fertilizer & seeds also water. no charge for medicine at the hospitals. people have more edcation, kids can have a good job when they grow-up. all of the people have food & water, they can have a better life style. but if everyone helps and can send something for the people in kenya we would be so happy that other kids are also happy this world would be free from diesas and everyone would love each other and kenya someday would be just like the u.s.a and they would help others like they where help. out of a poor country to a better, stronger, gooder country."	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3739	1	"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight agants proverty is achivable. why i think this is because it said in the text that ""they have had amazing progress."" it also said ""the attendence raite at the schools has shot up dermadicly."" ""there is medicen for all of the comom illnesses."" also farmers are getting suplies they need to grow things like ""seeds, fertalizer and toolds they need to grow things well. hopefully by 2015 people there will have better and healther lives. they had many probloms that were killing people. malaria is one thing ""that kills 20,000 kids every day"" and its vary sad because malaria is preventable and treatable. another problom is kids were not getting education that they need. they couldent go to school because it costs too much. the kids that could go to school were always tird when they got home and did not get a midday meal."	2	3		1	3	3	3																		
3741	1	"in my opinion, the other did convince me that we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. although it is bad, many of the things causing poverty are actually preventable. for example, malaria can be prevented and treated with bed nets and medicine. water supply can be fixed with an irrigation system. farming problems can be solved by using better inventory and supplies. all this happened in four years. imagine what can happen in the next 8 years with many new inventions that can help out this poverty."	2	2		1	2	2	2																		
3742	1	yes it is achievable because almost anything is possible. and as you can see in the story it was tough times. but they over came and then the school started serving food for the children. they also had lots of other stuff happen to like the attendance started to raise higher alos. the changes started to occur in 80 villages acrodd sub-saharan africa. and they only made process in just 4 years. people also fought for better health. then the yala sub district hospital finally had medicine. and water became connected to hospital also. and there where no more school fees!!. and thats how i know its achievable in our lifetime.	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3750	1	"yes, i think the author is right because the hospitals have medicines free of charge. also because now school is free of charge the kids can go and become successful. another reason why i think itÕs possible is because there is electricity now so the doctors can work longer. lastly the kids have lunch because schools serve lunch now and the kids will have energy to stay focused."	4	5		1	4	4	4																		
3752	1	"yes.  i agree because at the begining of the text, they didnÕt have a lot of money because kid and alduts die evey day they need money for treatment.  and supply for school.  in my lifetime i think where we live at.  we always had money for school supplys and lunch.  i think winning against poverty you can build a lot of building and more school."	4	4		0	3	4	3																		
3757	1	"i'm convinced by this article becase this project is making good progress on the people of sauri. when the author came to sauri in 2004, people had no enough money to afford medicine to cure malaria, a common disease in africa. people also had not enough money to let their kids go to school. htey had barely ny tools to help plant crops that they can eat. in 2008, the millenium villages project made good progress. ""the yalla-sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases.""

3769	1	"my answer is yes the athour did convince me that ""winning the figh againts poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". one reason the authour convinced me is because in the text it says ""but the students wanted to learn. all of them worked hard with the few supplies they hard."" so that got me thinking that our shools in the u.s. have everything they need to learn but we dont work our hardest, but the kids in africa work their hardest with only some supplie stha thtey could afford. another reason the author convicned me is because in the text it says ""a bed net treateetd with chemicals that lasts for 5 years, keeps malrial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. each net costs 5 dollars."" so that means that it is easy for us to buy but not so much for them because 5 dollars over there is a lot. so why dont we buy the nets nd donate because their isnt any malarial mosquitoes in the u.s. but 20,000 kids die in africa every day. i also think the author convinced me because in the text it also says that in 4 years the hospitals had electricity and running water, kids in sauri, africa have supplies for schoool and that every sleeping site had bed nets, and that was just 2008 imagine in 2012. so this is why the author convinced me that ""winning the figeht agints pverty is achievable in our lfietime."""	3	3		2	4	3	4

3793	1	"121601y3_ 000510544 yes, the author convinced me by telling me (the reader) how at one point the millennium villages had nothing to having every thing. so, first the schools charged a fee, the farmers crops are dying and the hospital had no water, electricity, or medicine. there were no bed nets. lots of people was in proverty or people had little to no money. because of this people was dying and they had no money. in the article the girl said that pople was earning less than an dollar a day. over the years all this started to improve. there were bed nets, electricity in hospitalas well as medicine, there were no school fees so kids were able to get education, and the crops (the farmers) were able to live because the farmers may have got enough money. this proves that if you try hard enough you can achieve, Òwinning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. i also think this article is inspiring because it tells how you can succeed if y ou keep your eye on the prize. (extras) this article is written in the first person. it uses ÒweÓ a lot. the girls is explaining her experience. i think that the athor could had one more text feature. a photo graph of the people in proverty. i think itÕll help the reader understand the conditions they were in and the challeges they faced. (my opinion) i liked this article because i learned something new. i learned about the conditions the millennium villages had. i also feel bad for them because they (most likely) didnÕt have sanitation ficillities so the/the water could be clean. also they didnÕt have all the things we have in america there. i would (if i could) help them with all the things they need. like food or water. i would vollenter to help. this is my thoughts about the millennium villages."	5	5		3	4	4	4																		
3794	1	"i think that it is possible to end poverty, because if we/they try hard and get the things we need, like school supplies more hospitals, and more schools. if we can get people to donate money to a fundraiser for the people in poverty, maybe the people in africa can buy more bednets. they say that bednets cost $5 in us money, so stores can maybe just use half of their money share or at least a part of their profit, & they can donate it to the people who need bednets. this article convinced me that it is possible to end poverty, but no time soon. maybe in the future, but not right now. i mean, who knows? suddenly, there can be a person who donates millions of dollars to people living in poverty & they could at least have an apartment/home to stay in. so my final opinion is that it can be possible, but not right now. in 10 years or so, that can happen."	3	4		1	4	3	4																		
3797	1	"no because they still wont have money because itÕs not easy giving money out because they olny get less than an dollar. and also its not easy makeing on hospital, people their have to be ready, focus, and be prepare for everything and this will take years this will take years because you got to get people who is trioned but they will want money to work. and i say no because its going to take alot of money to get kids to go to school and get them some materials like pencils, clothes and for their school they will need some materials too like paper, and books."	3	3		1	4	4	4																		
3801	1	i think this group will be able to help solve proverty because they have alot of hope. i think this group of people called the Òunited nationsÓ are actually determined to end proverty. examples: 1) these peoble went around and looked for things they could help with 2) they start to think of solutions to the problems on the other hand proverty might not end even if people try to help end it. there still may have people that cant afford to get there child/children in school examples: people live off of less than 1 dollar 2) they wear ragged/ripped clothing some people cant even afford homes or new clothing maybe also they wont even be able to afford food.	2	2		0	2	2	2																		
3802	1	"yes, i think kid and familys should have bed nets. it would save many of the kids liveÕs. the bed nets should be free everyone so friend and family could be safe. it would also provlent 20,000 kids from die every day. i think the school should have better supplies. and the u.s. should help the kid in need. also they should have food at schools. they should to die becuase they are hungry. i think they should have tons and tons of water. like the u.s. if this was happening to all of america we would have had all of the school supplies. we would have all the water and medicen. we would have had all we needed so why were we leting all this happen to africa."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3803	1	"the author convinced me tha winning the fight against proverty because from the article their goal is supose to be met by 2015. they are capable of meeting their goals. one of the goals is, that they are tring to get the kenya people out of porvety. they want to help people with their health. they are tring to get school supplies, fertilizer, and medicine. there were 3 kids in a bed and 2 adults in a bed. the room were packed with people that needed doctors. the doctors did not have the medicine or the patient did not have the money to pay. they did not have doctors to help medical patient. they had clinical officers controlling the hospital. there is a disease called malaria, it is very common in africa. lots of the kids have been dieing from this diseae. mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night time. people that have children can not attend school because the parents can not afford the school fees. the kids also donÕt know how to do there chores. in 2008 the sauri people made a progress in four years. they have more supplies and they also have fertilizer and seeds. they now have a doctor. every on have bed nets on there beds. they have acomplised there goals in four goals."	3	3		2	4	4	4																		
3804	1	"with my thinking yes i think the quality is not prefect, but not done. in for years theyÕve got much done. for example, in the beginning the hospital could not care for all its patients. another is lots of people got a disease called malaria. people get malaria from mosquitoes. they carry it, so when they bite they infect people. malaria was preventable buy them because they only made less than a dollar. in sauri, kenya they had school but it had a price. nobody had enough money. they only had little school supplies so they share a lot but it wasnÕt enough .if  school didnÕt cost money anyone could go. the kids that could they were tried at the end of school would be tried because they dont have lunch. the reason is the crops could not grow because the did not have enough water and fertilizer. so lots of people staved. after 4 years the united nation made sauri, kenya look better. hospilals had more medince cheaper , more bed net , and less people were dying. the schools had more supplies and they had lunches. so kids were not tried at the end of the day. then most inportmently school was free so lots of people went there. all school lunches were made by the crops that were freshly fertilizer and thank to the united nation. even with some things gone the united nation still have a long way to go. they even said they wonÕt be done untill 2025"	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3805	1	"kyle_020022113 winning the fight against poverty is a goal that can be achieved in our lifetime. people are dying and there is no way that people can be so lazy or heartless not to help. people in kenya are in poverty. they are starving or getting sick. all that they live off is a dollar a day. helping isnÕt so hard. hospitals need better help. Òthe rooms were packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford itÓ. the writer says, if we send doctors with experience to go help, they can make a huge difference. the lack of money ties into this. malaria is common in kenya, but people donÕt have enough money to buy a bed net. 5 dollars is easy for us to come by. we can help them easily, people also die of starvation. if people could get supplies they need, they could all be fed. people worry about not having enough for their families. if we could get water and fertilizer, the whole village could be supplied. Òwill their kids go hungry and become sick?Ó they wonÕt if we can help them. education is another issue, people want to learn, but schools have minimal supplies. parents cannot pay for school either. we can help give books or paper. we have so much supplies here that it wouldnÕt make a difference if we gave some away. overall, we can help. after four years, hospitals have medicine and many people also have water. if we keep doing what weÕre doing, we can make a huge difference in no time. these people need help, and we should help them."	3	2		2	3	2	3																		
3818	1	"yes, she conviced me because before we die, we can go to other villages and bring them supplies like medicine, food, water, ferterlizer etc. also, she convinced me because, we can donate money to organizations that help african villages. this way, they can give african villages 4 dollars a day instead of 1 dollar a day. she also convinced me because first their schools had no air conditioning, and had no lunch. now, they have a midday lunch, and air conditioning. also, when the mosquitos bite them, they get malaria, a harmful disease that can kill children, and make adults very sick. when we donate our money, they can get all kinds of medicines to treat maleria. also, when we donate our money, we can get tons of beds for the kids and adults in the hospitals instead two adults and three in one bed."	4	4		1	4	4	4

3836	1	"getting rid of poverty in those villages wonÕt be easy.  thething is, we donÕt know how many people are living a life of poverty.  but i think that if everyone donates a little, it might be gone by 2015. for example, look at the second to last paragraph.  she said that already in four years the hospital that had no water or electricity now has that.  the schools now have school supplies.  the people have fertilizer and seeds to start growing food.  the schools now also serves lunch to students.  they just need to keep this up. they will need more money to finish the project.  hannah said that she saw many families with torned up clothes and no food.  she was able to help many people but there are still more out there.  they will need the money to help them.  what if there are a thousand people left or more.  the medicine and nets and other supplies only cost about five dollars or less.  but imagine getting those supplies for a thousand people.  that will be a lot of money. i believe that we have the power to help those poor families get out of poverty.  we just need to work harder.  we need more people to donate.  and if we do get more volunteers, then maybe we can rid those villages of poverty by 2015.  we have three years left till then.  letÕs make the best of those years."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3841	1	yes she convinced me.  they made good progress they have medicine to treat others and it free of charge too.  they got new fertilizer and tools and seeds to maintain food supplies.  change have occured in 80 villages across the sub-saharan africa.  and they have bed nets.  one thing that the hospital have water and electricity.	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
3850	1	"can we win the fight against poverty? i donÕt think so.  i think that going to sauri and 80 other villages across sub-saharan africa only was achieved because of the money over there.  for example, one dollar over hear in america is like cheap cash that you canÕt buy much with, but over there, $1 can maybe buy them a pair of shoes.  money over there is less than us, so our money seems like a lot to them.  so the people doing the project only spend maybe a couple hundred for a big change in each village.  but coming over to america to solve our poverty problems is a whole different story.  our country is very expensive, so who would have enough money to pay for all of our poverty?  who?  there is always poverty in each country, but do you think that we have enough money to solve all of that?  even in donations.  like on the second page in the first passage, a net for them only costs $5!  5.  they canÕt even afford that.  but us, we could.  well most of us.  even people in canada could afford it.  if i were to go and live in sauri now with my family, we would be the rich to them.  what will maybe happen is that the country that has more money will help the weaker one.  that will go on and on with the countries until there is 1 country that costs too much to be able to solve its poverty.  this is only my opinion and prediction.  this is only someones dream.  and like in the article, these people feel sorry for them.  i think that is the nice that they do help the people, but like i said before, who would help the countries that cost too much to even live in?  well our country maybe not as poor, but we still have a lot of poverty too.  not as much though i do think that we can solve the poverty in the extra poor countries though, because their money is less compared to us, so we wonÕt be spending a lot compared to canada or other different places.  hopefully, the world will change in a good way.  i do like to see people who were really sad but got happy because of people who helped them.  i love to see people be happy and smile a lot too.  hopefully in a few years, i will be proved wrong and poverty will end.  hopefully.  when i grow up, i will be the kidn of person that donates all i can to the people who really need it.  even if iÕm really poor.  i will do all that i can.  hopefully my fellow classmates will too.  it wonÕt be easy though.  but with the help, it can go a long way.  whenever my school had a food drive, i would always donate.  itÕs easy, and knowing that you have helped someone can really make you happy.  it make me happy."	3	3		0	2	3	2																		
3852	1	"winning a fight against proverty is achievable with water, food, and health. in many places of provety, dirty water ruins peoples health. water is nessesary for people to live. having little, none, of dirty water can effect a person's health serverly. the author mentioned that, making me realize how unhealthy proverty is. also in many places food is scarce. food is also nessesary for life. without food people could die from starvation. providing food for those in proverty can help keep them alive. the author mention this which made me realize how deadly proverty is. the health in proverty is poor. mentioned in this passage, the hospital in sauri, kenya was full of dying people. but no on e was caring for them. i imagine the health in other laces of proverty is just as bad. this was mention in the passage, making me see how many people are dying in proverty. i hope that this paragraph convinced you that winning the fight against proverty is possible by providing the right items, such as food, water, and health benifits."	3	3		1	3	3	3

3961	1	"the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. what africa needs to do is have people do jobs. like for instance they can wash cars for states near them. they can also make bed sheets to put over the bed before sleeping on them. like in the text it said that they keep on getting malaria from mosquitoes that carry malaria. to keep the plants from dieing, that need to mix substance together that can protect the plants and that could not harm the ocean. to get food for the people they need to do some fishing. they can catch fish that are not infected with diseses. in order for the students to get knowledge, they and the parents should get together and the parents should teach them what they know. what they need to about health care is that they need to drink alot of water so they won't get sick in the first place. they should have kids stay inside half of the time stop being outside all day and that aplies for everyone. to get clean water they can collect water in a bottle then pock some holes in it then get another bottle then pour the water into the other bottle then all the insects that was in the water will stay in the first bottle then the bottle with the water in it will be at least good enough to drink."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3962	1	"yes she convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achivable in our lifetimeÓ because in year of 2004 africa had lots of people poor, sick, hungry, and more. but we helped them by getting water and electricity for hospital. by taking out school fees so poor people would be able to learn. also hunger is helped by ferterlizer and seeds for farming and tools needed for food supply."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3963	1	"yes, i do think that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". in this essay i will give my top 3 reasons why. one reason is in 2004 healthcare was bad. at the hospital there were 3 kids or 2 adults to one bed. also, the hospital did not have running water or electricity. the hospital rooms were pack with patients who probably would no recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patient could not afford it. also, 20,000 kids are dying a day from the preventable, treatable, and common disease of malaria. another reason is in 2004 crops were dying because the farmers could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. each year the farmers worried about having enough food for their whole family or if their kids would go hungry and become sick. also, many kids did not go to school because they could not afford the school fees. some kids were needed at home to help with chores. the schools had minimal supplies, but the students wanted to learn. all of the students worked hard with few supplies. it was hard for them to concetrate because there was no midday meal. lastly, in four years there was amazing progress. the hospital has medicine, free of charge, for common diseases. the hospital has water and electricity. bed nets are used at every sleeping sites. bed nets are nets that are treated with chemicals to keep the malaria infested mosquitos away. the hunger crisis has been addressed with ferilizer, seeds, and tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no more school fees and lunch is served at school. in conclusion i think ""winning the fight againtst poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". if that much proggres was made in four years, poverty will decrease in 4 more years."	4	3		3	4	3	4																		
3968	1	"yes, i think we can win the war against poverty. if in sauri it took 4 years just to get electricity and water running to the hospital and fertilizer and seeds for the crops, school supplies for the kids, bed nets to keep away from the malaria disease, and medicine for the patients without charge then other places that are like sauri would be a better place for the residence. but we could not be so sure about that. poverty is everywhere in the world. and we can't help them if we don't know they exist or not. if the health in sauri was terrible witht the mosquites with malaria and 20,000 kids ding quickly once bitten then imaging how everyplace like sauria is, but they probably have a bed net but, have to schare it with someone else. the seeds and fertilizers was a good thing and it's not so much to buy. sauri now has crops for food so families won't have little food and kids not starving. with the water they also have for the crops and hospitals is a good thing to. the water for the hospital is great because clean water equals to a less bacteria person."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3971	1	"i would like to think so. i mean, there are alot of people out there. suppose i live to be 70-90, with 60 something years to go. i believe we can help people get out of poverty. Òthe people of sauri have made amazing progress in just 4 years.Ó look, theyÕve done so much in four years. we could probably help others. of course, the rate of change from poor to average would depend on how many people were on the job. it also depends on how skilled the ÒhelpersÓ are. for example, if one of the people on the job was a docter, i could tell him to go help the hospital. this is just sad; Òthere was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital.Ó the doctor/somebody with medical knowledge could teach the hospital. last thing, even if we canÕt win the fight over poverty in my lifetime, we would get a lot done. many people would be much happier. Òdramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across the sub-saharan africa.Ó i suppose we could do that for others. then everybody would be happy."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3972	1	"currently, there are many place still having proverty like the author mentioned which is in africa. in my opinion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because people can help by donate a little money for a poor country.  if everyone gives a little bit, the better life the poor will have. poverty is a very hard thing to improve for a country. but if people do something more for the society, the less poverty they had. in ""a better life - 2008"" in the text, ""the people of sauri made amazing progress in just four years."" this is an example of improveing. if people are really trying to help people, society and the whole country, there's no such thing ""poverty."" ""the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity."" before it was a place that had no any treatment for disease. 20,000 ids died from the disease, malaria, each day, and they lack of food and water. it's a very hard situation to survive in this kind of place. but used 6 years only., they had a big change. from a hard situation to survive to a better place that has a little technology. so if people continue to work harder on improving, there won't be ""poverty"" oh! some people says it is imposible to fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. they may say ""what if people don't like to work and being lazy. or they don't have enough money to do this and that for people."" the thing i want to say is that being lazy really can't against poverty, if they don't want to work, the affect that happen to them is what they deserve. if people really want a better life, they will work for it! and poverty is no longer exist. things and of course it took time. but if one really try to work hard and improve the life that one have, poverty won't happen. once again, in my opinion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime!"	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3974	1	"people need help in africa, and we need to help and i think we can help to people who needs help because there are people who are willing to.  there is also this thing called the millenium villages project which tries to help the people out of poverty. cons are that 20,000 kids die from dieases a day.  people canÕt even afford getting treatment because people in sauri lived on less than $1 a day.  not only that but the hospital did not even have enough supplies.  farmers had poor crops because of lack of water.  which leads to the few kids who could go to school, they didnÕt have mid-day meal in school.  we may not even acheive the goal when it reaches 2015. still, there are pros.  kids want to attend school, and there are people who want to help, and give support.  we can help by giving support, cooperate with these things.  we can donate money, clothing, anything!  we could lend some water.  with these things we can turn the cons into pros.  with these helpful ideas we can acheive the project in no time!"	2	2		1	2	2	2

3992	1	"based on this example, i believe that the quality of life in sauri can be improved in our lifetime. i believe this because major changes have been made over the years to improve the life in sauri. for example, in the text it states, ""the yala-sub district hospital has medicince, free of charge, for all of the most common disease."" having free medicine for the most commone diseases is a big step because hospitals now have most of the medicines needed to help treat patients. a big step like this is already a good start to saving thousands of lives. in the article, the infromation says, ""bed nets are used in very sleeping site in sauri."" in my opinion, this would be the beginning of something great. without the bed nets, mosquitos were infecting humans with a disease called malaria. this disease was very tragic. everyone's life was at risk. now that there are bed nets being provided, the rate of lives being taken away is much lower. people wont have to worry about getting a deadly disease or fear going to sleep. i would say that one of the biggest changes is that the problems farmers had was being addressed. they were now proivded with fertilizer and seeds, along with toools to keep their land in great shape. no longer do the farmers have to worry about making enough to maintain the foos supply. farmers would be able to provide for their families and their farm. last but not least, another great change was taking away school fees and serving midday meals for the children. as a resule, the attendance rate was much higher at school. families could send their children to school and not worry about having to pay a fee. children could get a great education for free. due to the fact that school lunches were provises, kids had energy and would less likely be so hungry. there were so many changes that were made. i truly believe that with everyone's help and support, the goals set for the future can and will be reached. it's amazing to see just how far a country in africa can go, when everyone sticks together and helps eachother out. based on the article, i definitely believe that together we can stop the high rates of poverty in sauri. i am a firm believer that if you believe it, you can achieve it."	4	3		1	4	3	4																		
3995	1	"yes, i think that the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against proverty, because in the story it says, that in 2004, ""sauri was very poor they didn't have water, electricty, and had no money."" also, that affcted them because they needed money so they can gain more money, so it can help them get achiveve their goals. also, they has mosquitoes that bit them and gave them malaria when they bit the people of sauri. also, in sauri proverty is achieveable because in the story it says, ""the hospital's in sauri had medicine."" also the villages had water and electricity. for example, ""the hunger crisis has been addresssed with fertilizer and seeds."" also, there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished, but that will be a very hard task. but can we make those solutions? yes, be uniting with other people from sauri to gain richess and wealth. but sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against proverty in 2004 people were hungry, people were selling bannas of the street, no electricty and water, but all of that can change in 4 years by working together in diffrent ways. also, there were no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students because they didn't have any midday meals to provide them with energy they need to help them with the rest of their days. also, dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages. like the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages projects. what will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-skricken areas for good. why, because i want this kind of poverty to be a kind of history."	3	3		1	4	4	4

4014	1	"based on the artical yes the author convinced me that fighting aginst proverty and helping is possible in our lifetime. i think its possible because you can work with other people, donate, and give food, money, cloths, and also spread the word that people need help and maybe people will help give stuff to the poor to go aginst proverty. this is a big job but you reach out to others and have others help i think it would be more helpful. something that convinced me was how the people in 2004 started out with nothing and by 2008 they were able to accomplish school lunches, school supplies, medicine, electricity, water, for hospital, and more. that convince me that we can make a change if we all worked together. they helped 80 vilages across sub-saharan africa that made huge differences. i think by this rate they can help other poor villages and make a change to others. this convinced me that i could make a difference if i help and donate to to others, by helping plant so people could harvest and feed there familys by donating cloths, paper, water, and money  to help familys rise from proverty. when i first was reading i thought how are they going to supply all that stuff and i thought it was impossible but if you reach out and donate it is possible to make a huge change just like that. they made sure the people in kenya have the stuff that they need to survive. just reading this convinced me that you could make a change the acomplished so much in just 4 years imagine what they could do in 15, they could stop proverty around the world."	4	4		1	4	3	4																		
4016	1	i think we can achieve the goal against poverty because we could send them things. we can send them school supplies because they don't have that much school supplies. we can also send them money so they can afford doctors in the hospital. we acn also send them fod so they can eat. that's why i think we can achieve the goal. my second reason is that we can all come together and help. some people can work on sending different things. we can also try to go there and give them care packages. we will try to ask teh government there to help them out. that is my second reason why we can achieve the goal. my third reason is that we can go there and build houses. we can set up a team of people. we can send logs and tools and different things. we can also just pray for them. that is why i think we can achieve teh goal.	4	4		1	4	3	4

4078	1	"based on the article, the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ is acheviable. in 2004, life for people in sauri, kemya, was bad. almost all of the familes were in poverty, with no medicine, fertilizer running water, electricity, etc/ however, a company called the millenium villages helped sauri. in 2004, when the author first went to sauriÕs hospital, she saw that it was in need ot assistance. 3 kids or 2 adults were on a bed, there was no medicine, there wasnÕt even a doctor. not even running water or electricity. many people died from malaria, because they couldnÕt afford bed nets. in 2008 though, when they checked for progress, the hospital had medicine, free of charge, with running water and electricty. overall, i think in my lifetime, we can Òwin the fight against poverty.Ó in 4 yeas, a village with almost ntohing recieved help to make a hospital that is working without problems. it really helped me believe that we can Òwin the fight against povertyÓ."	4	4		1	4	4	4

4106	1	"corda_020052158 yes because you could work hard if you want to get all the things like medicine and being poor is not bad because the only thing it matter is to have clothes, food, and somewhere to live. the that convince me is what it really take is for the world to work together to change poverty to be a thing of history. itÕs true when you work together as a team you win but if you work by yourself you get nothing because thereÕs no one for they could help itÕs allways better working together. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds as well as tools needed to maintain the food supply.the hunger crisis is really bad because sometimes you could die because sometime you donÕt have medicines and your sick and you could die and when you donÕt have food you get really skinny and your bones could see."	3	3		0	4	4	4

4150	1	"yes! because it talks about how disease have been spread into villages and can cause death or illness. for example 20,000 kids died from the disease each day. another one is that disease can cause death, illness or life. the third example is that malaria is one disease that can cause death and it common in africa. you can help get rid of the disease by helping giving medicine to the people that need the medicine."	3	3		0	4	4	4

4179	2	"In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4181	2	"Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's, music, movie's, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books. There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc.     Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out. I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like. But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's.     If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf. So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4183	2	"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4191	2	I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4193	2	"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news."	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
4197	2	"Opinion      I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4203	2	"Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4206	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,      I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands."	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
4222	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music"	4	4		4	4	4	4

I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else.     I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good"	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4230	2	"Offensive @CAPS1     @CAPS1. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4235	2	"Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4240	2	"I think they souldnt be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opions . one person @MONTH1 think a book is offensive but the next @MONTH1 not. Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive  there would be no books left. Because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont. There are many books out there that not everybodys gonna like the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong"	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
4241	2	"Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4243	2	"In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all"	3	3		3	2	2	2

By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4254	2	"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4264	2	i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4276	2	"What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4285	2	"Do people take offensive books serious. There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4291	2	"Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2?          I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4296	2	"Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library.  I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.     This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen.

4300	2	"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4301	2	"I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4309	2	I don't think certin matrials should be removed from library shelvs. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelvs the lirarians don't force them to choose the item. It is a free country and i think people should choose what they wan't. If the people don't like it then read the back of the movie or book before you choose it.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4314	2	"There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4326	2	"Library Censorship     Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive.     Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area.     The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting.     The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area.     Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4329	2	"You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4330	2	I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want	3	3		3	2	2	2

4359	2	"Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offened by homework, take it out of @ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I belive they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1. Teenages like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just over look these books and pick another.     If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 students interested you shouldn't take out book that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a diffrent one. I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but i did not tell the libraian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved to read that book.      Everyone has diffrent oppions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books. I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offened someone was taken out of the schoolt there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2. See everyone has a diffrent oppion on everything. That just isn't right.      In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and librarys. They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing. With out some of these books I myself wouln't like reading. So lets be mature aldults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4361	2	"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4364	2	Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4367	2	"I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons.  This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4370	2	"No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4378	2	"Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4384	2	"I do not believe that materiales in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too.     It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group.     If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless.     In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.     The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4385	2	"Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair.  A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4387	2	"Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I beleave they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like.     Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like. and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness. They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for.     All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people? Well thats how they feel when that happens to them.      What would be put in there places? Stores have to have something to fill the shevles. Would they put more candy to make the world fat?      If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it.

Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion."	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4400	2	"Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style.          Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. To each, its own."	4	3		4	4	4	4

I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people"	3	3		3	3	3	3

Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.     The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.     The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4408	2	"Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.       In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away. I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been.     In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4410	2	"I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4413	2	"A @CAPS1 is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4414	2	"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4416	2	"Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4421	2	"Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries.     My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book.      I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet.     There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult.     These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4422	2	"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4429	2	"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4434	2	"I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.          I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4440	2	"Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4448	2	"The last thing I would want my children seeing in a @CAPS1 is offensive material. a @CAPS1 is thought of as a learning zone. Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment.      My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.     I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm. But that @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.      In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocense. Having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.     When I was a little girl I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.     I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time.          Sincerely, @PERSON1"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4449	2	"How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor boks do so in your own library.     Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers.     There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.      In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading. Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. @CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier.     When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason.      In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4450	2	"I do not belive that they should be takein off the shelfs beacuse @CAPS1 people still come to get that sort of stuff. @CAPS1 people say is not plite for little kids 'well keek your kids away from it then.'             @CAPS1 people dont like it and @CAPS1 people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say. It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can.            Noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it. If you dont like it dont look at it. @CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @CAPS2 shouldnt even be a problem. @CAPS2 is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. That is there opinon.             In conclusion  I think if you dont read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff you are trying to be something you are not. Trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that.  We all get a laugh out of @CAPS2 kind of stuff."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4451	2	"In my opinion, books that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4452	2	"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4454	2	Well people should be able to get whatever they want if there an adult kids should not but what can you do. It wouldnt be right to take away things that people like.	1	1		1	1	1	1																		
4458	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?  I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves.  There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it.  Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.       One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote.  She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf.  Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day.  Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.       Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this.  As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1.  Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries.  Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing.  How would a library handle this situation.  If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries.  There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it.  Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it.  They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves.  There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.       My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies.  Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve.  If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective.  The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner.  It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc.  The public has to accept those choices.  You have to look at it from their view.  Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them.  It's just not the right way to handle things.     After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that.  It's never been that way and it should never be that way.  Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate.  But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4459	2	"Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4461	2	"Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4469	2	"Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4479	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion.

4482	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, ect. should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line.  If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone.     I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone.  I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff.  I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves.  We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.       Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway.  Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4490	2	"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4491	2	"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4508	2	"I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad.  I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required.       In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library.  Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours.  Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence.  This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads.  It @MONTH1 teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they @MONTH1 think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.      On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books.  I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present.  While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know.  In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.       In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already.  This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them.  Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice.      All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people.  They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied.  Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please.  On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4514	2	"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4527	2	"Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries."	4	3		4	4	4	4

The one about do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. i went back and fore on this, first i was thinking that if it was offensive to some people  then we sould take it down bucese if it offensiveds people then why are we selling it to the people, but then i get to thinking agian and  i was like people have the right to freedom of space and if this how they what to talk then let them space there mind.     this great courtry of ares was made on the right that every one is made the same and every one inteialed to the freedom of space. if people what to talk like thet do in there music or act they way they what to in there movies its there life if yuo dont like it dont buy it are even pay an attient to it.say if i was a raper like lil wayne or some one like that i would care about the people who are talking the way they are bucese it is my way of tilling the world how i feel about thing that are on my mind.if some one writtes some thing in a book that you dont like dont go all out and go on tv shows to make fun or till how you feel writte i letter to the author and till them how yuo feel about the topic.     every person black, white, yellow, brown, or even green has the right to freedom of space. was give to us for a ressen and i think it was for that even if you have idia but you think it is supted just say it bcuese some people think that is amazing or not. but every one is created the same so treat people the way you wont to be treated. i would like to thank you for reading this. your artedcile really open my eyes to the world and how i sould see it. thank you for writting it.                                                                   sincely,                                                              @PERSON1"	3	3		3	2	2	2

I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good"	3	3		3	1	2	1																		
4531	2	"Book Censorship     Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.     The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion.     Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered. Age groups on books, is a great idea."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4533	2	"I believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not.       I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4537	2	"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4543	2	"People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant.     The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed.     Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it.     Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story.     In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4551	2	"This essay is about cenorship for the libarys well their shouldn't because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels.     should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics. The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more.     Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms.     Books!!! should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them. That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids. Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read.     T.V. shows! is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more. But its gets to you. Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the movie. Am i right?     All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that. It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work. When they can be with their familys!!!

4553	2	"Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive.      From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.      Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.     As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.      Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.      I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4556	2	"I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4566	2	"REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH.     BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE. WITH BOOKS SUCH AS '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK. @NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE. LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX. WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ.

WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON. BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! THINK: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?'

4575	2	"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4591	2	"All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4598	2	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised.     People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?      Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life.      Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4605	2	"Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4607	2	"Do yo think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4612	2	"In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4615	2	"Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4617	2	"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4619	2	"Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair.     Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4620	2	"I beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves.     In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group.     All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4623	2	"In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4624	2	"Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4626	2	"Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment,  to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done.     For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else.     If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else.     Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to.     Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4627	2	"I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed"	3	3		3	4	3	4

There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.

4631	2	"Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf.

4648	2	"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4653	2	"Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young.

There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence.     When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision.     Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them.     The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it.      I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4671	2	"I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.     I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.     Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.     Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4674	2	"Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4679	2	"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4685	2	"Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4690	2	"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4694	2	"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety"	4	3		4	3	4	3

Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
4701	2	"@CAPS1 are many prespectives on censorship in our country. Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it, @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4702	2	"I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you."	3	3		3	4	4	4

I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it.

4720	2	"I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4723	2	"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4724	2	"I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion.  If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it.     If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place.  If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more.  So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more.  so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better.     If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad.  My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right.  So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you.     As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them.  I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest).  I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area.     So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv.

4726	2	"Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter. What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future.          Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do.          By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television.       What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow.      Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4728	2	"I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4729	2	"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~@PERSON1"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4737	2	"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4740	2	"What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!"	4	4		4	4	4	4

MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM,MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE.  WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN.

4745	2	"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4751	2	"I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4754	2	"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4760	2	"Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4774	2	"I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are.

In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative.""

The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.

""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3	3		3

Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen.

12157	5	"Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life."	2	3		3																					
12158	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful).""

12162	5	"The memoir reflects the memories and traditions created in a Cuban family home. The author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story. @CAPS1 uses words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to describe his family and house. @CAPS1 also creates a sense of pride in his parents and family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was always growing. His parents doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family.

That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1."	2	1		2																					
12168	5	"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."	2	2		2

12178	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more.	1	2		2

In paragraph three and four, he tells how the environment he grew up in instilled that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He recalls past neighbors, and surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet.

Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."	2	2		2																					
12195	5	"The mood of the storry is happy. She discribes how lucky she is to have parents like her own, and be Cuban. She loves the music, the food, and the culture. She's glad her parent were careing and helped people."	1	2		2

12212	5	"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close Ð knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. "	4	4		4																					
12213	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions."	4	3		4																					
12216	5	"What is the mood, created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done.""

12230	5	"In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way."	2	3		3																					
12233	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
12235	5	"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."	2	3		3																					
12245	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."	1	1		1																					
12248	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2		3																					
12251	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3

Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness.

He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable.

Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times.""

In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness.

12814	5	The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious.

12830	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful).""

I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."	4	4		4																					
13083	5	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times."	3	4		4																					
13086	5	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."	3	2		3																					
13093	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."	4	4		4																					
13094	5	"The author of the memoir mood created was intence, strange, happy and sad. Happy because the change the simple house to a home. Sad because is hard to leave something behind.

13129	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez's mood was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signify's all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed."	4	3		4																					
13131	5	"The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.

13141	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him oppurtunities, even when it @MONTH1 have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; Filled with love."	4	4		4																					
13142	5	The mood in this story is sad because the person leaves cuba and someone in the family dies. But the person has big dreams and becomes a fashion designor	0	1		1																					
13144	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home."	4	3		4																					
13149	5	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!"	3	3		3																					
13155	5	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading."	2	3		3																					
13161	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness. According to the last sentence were @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is great. @PERSON1 has many memories of the home that are positive and he also learned from what his parents taugh him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from cuba to the unided states to start their lifes new."	2	2		2

13179	5	"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination."	2	3		3																					
13194	5	"The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that.  Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love.""

13196	5	"The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love.

She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking and so do her parents. She loves listening to Cuban music also. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple home, her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special."	2	2		2																					
13318	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest and that mood is perseverence. The mood perseverence is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing.

13323	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it?"	2	3		3																					
13324	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very solidary mood. The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba.

They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family."	2	2		2																					
13330	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso created a few moods that are very relatable, yet make you think. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefullness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him what he is now."	4	4		4

13334	5	"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (¦ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (¦ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (¦ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (¦ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations."	4	4		4																					
13338	5	"I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the athor is talking about his first friend (land loards daghter) the great cooking and music that his home had. how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, all the celibrations they had for people, how everybody in the naborhood were friends, and much he loved his family.

""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way."	3	2		3																					
13345	5	"The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents."	4	3		4																					
13346	5	"The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him."	3	2		3																					
13353	5	In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories. As a child the author's memories were happy and home setting mostly the mood was good throughout the story. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good.	1	1		1																					
13362	5	"The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud."	2	2		2																					
13364	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful.

13368	5	"The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love."	1	2		2																					
13369	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez."	2	1		2

13377	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."	2	2		2																					
13381	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1																					
13389	5	"The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us.""  Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family."	4	4		4																					
13400	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life."	1	1		1																					
13424	5	"The @CAPS1 Created in the @CAPS2 is Not that of a @CAPS3 one.

In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful. Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are.By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time."	4	3		4

13451	5	The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.	2	1		2																					
13454	5	"The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home.""

13459	5	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez the mood of the auther created was very peaceful. It was saying how it was a traditional cuban home and there was passionate cuban music that filled the air. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen. There's tons of loving people around the house too. Which makes it home and comfertable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they wernt blood related. ""Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company"	3	2		3																					
13461	5	"In this article, the authors mood seemed to be happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home."	3	2		3																					
13462	5	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir."	3	4		4																					
13464	5	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere.

Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support."	2	2		2																					
13471	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	3		3

13532	5	"In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy."	3	2		3																					
13541	5	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1, he tells about how his parents immigrated from Cuba to The United States so that he could have a better life. He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his cuban culture because that's what he was raised with. The overall mood he created was gratefulness."	3	2		3																					
13542	5	"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author."	2	2		2																					
13544	5	"The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him."	2	2		2																					
13547	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness."	4	4		4																					
13548	5	"This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. In this memoir the author states""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir."	1	1		1																					
13550	5	"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with eachother, visit with eachother, and help eachother. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	1	2		2																					
13557	5	"The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail.

13570	5	"The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words.

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative.

We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we donÕt and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learnerÕs permit test.

So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,Óthen she will take that test again.Ótherefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.

Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine.

The whole story was filled with sadness about SaengÕs family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be.

The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.

For example, she added Òhibiscus is budding.Ó Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying.

8943	4	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.

8971	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength.

Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe itÕs saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph."	1	2		2																					
9057	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
9064	4	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the againÓ. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."	1	1		1

9071	4	"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning sheÕll survive also. Although the flower isnÕt the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant sheÕll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "	2	2		2

The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."	2	2		2																					
9111	4	"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud.

9128	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
9131	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
9132	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,ÓWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and donÕt  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
9134	4	"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. Òthe sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is Òstrong enough to make it through the cold months thatÕs what matters.Ó This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming ÒfamiliarÓ. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so itÕs fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "	3	3		3																					
9139	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once.

You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""IÕd love it,"" saeng said.

9146	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ means and this is why the author concluded it this way."	1	1		1																					
9147	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home.

The author adds this: ÒI mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
9149	4	"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ the author uses the conclusion Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againÓ he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says Òand in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wentÓ It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didnÕt pass her test she doesnÕt think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "	2	2		2																					
9152	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said ÒThen I will take that tes againÓ, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you donÕt succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says Òshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon seasonÓ. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time sheÕll do great."	1	2		2																					
9156	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she wonÕt give up if they donÕt. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.	2	1		2																					
9161	4	"In ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings.

By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant.

9166	4	"In the short story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.Ó This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.

If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."	2	2		2																					
9167	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. ÒIn the story it says, ÓWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrubÓ This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:Ð Òwhen the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.

9200	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like SaengÕs mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1		1

This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it.

In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story.

9215	4	"Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, ÒÉ and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,Ó it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "	2	2		2																					
9225	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same.

9230	4	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her ÒtestÓ.

I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better."	2	2		2

9253	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself.

9260	4	"The author concludes the story with Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring.

ÒThe   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."	3	3		3																					
9264	4	"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driverÕs test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. ÒAnd in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. ÒSaeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."	2	3		3																					
9267	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.	1	1		1

9282	4	"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didnÕt feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."	2	1		2																					
9285	4	"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"	2	2		2																					
9288	4	"The author concludes the story ÒWinter Hibiscus Ò this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as ÒThe wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.Ó The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is Òstrong enough to make it through the cold months hereÓ. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that Òmany of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to herÓ. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."	3	3		3																					
9292	4	"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.

9296	4	"The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that sheÕll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant."	1	1		1																					
9298	4	"The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driverÕs test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again"	1	2		2																					
9299	4	She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.	1	1		1																					
9306	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2																					
9311	4	The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.	0	0		0																					
9317	4	"All throughout the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for SaengÕs future and growing confidence."	2	2		2																					
9326	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that sheÕll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9328	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesnÕt like this test. And would rather not take it	0	0		0																					
9342	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has Òtear stains and puffy eyesÓ as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."	2	2		2																					
9344	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"	0	0		0																					
9371	4	"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower."	1	2		2																					
9374	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesnÕt matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1		1																					
9376	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.	2	2		2																					
9391	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didnÕt have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
9392	4	"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."	2	2		2																					
9393	4	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.	0	0		0																					
9395	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she canÕt do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9398	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9400	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give SaengÕs mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9401	4	"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, ÒThis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."	2	3		3																					
9410	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
9411	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. ItÕs explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."	0	0		0																					
9417	4	"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,Ó In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .Ó mean that when all is @CAPS1 .Ó She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I donÕt even know what she  failed  so I didnÕt  like it."	1	1		1																					
9422	4	"Determined, new beginning, symbolism Ð each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that sheÕs able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, Òand the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,Ó it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism Ð each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."	2	3		3																					
9427	4	"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents SaengÕs strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9436	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but youÕve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."	2	2		2																					
9438	4	"In the story, ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- ÒI mean its not the kind we at-at-Ò she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."	3	2		3																					
9440	4	"I think the author of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ said Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.Ó to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isnÕt giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."	1	1		1																					
9442	4	"In the short story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test Òwhen the snow melts and the geese return.Ó I believe that the Hibiscus and the driverÕs test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The authorÕs intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driverÕs test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "	3	3		3																					
9444	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ÓIts not a real oneÓ  ""Not like the kind we had before.Ó Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."	2	1		2																					
9454	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.

9457	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."	2	3		3																					
9458	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."	2	1		2																					
9461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.	1	1		1																					
9463	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
9484	4	"By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test.

Ò@CAPS1 I will take that test again.Ó (shows hope).ÓAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.Ó She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.

9503	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes SaengÕs determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes SaengÕs survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."	2	2		2																					
9505	4	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show SaengÕs  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother Ôs  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isnÕt  home she said Ò I failed the test .Ó This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasnÕt  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.	1	2		2																					
9512	4	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.	0	0		0

Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."	1	1		1																					
9519	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome.

9520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the ÒtestÓ again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."	1	1		1																					
9524	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
9525	4	"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flowerÕs determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flowerÕs survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"	3	3		3																					
9529	4	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.	1	1		1																					
9536	4	"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."	0	0		0

I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."	1	1		1																					
9548	4	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesnÕt come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, thatÕs for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."	1	1		1																					
9562	4	"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"	3	3		3																					
9566	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example Òthe winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew byÓ, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph."	1	1		1

9570	4	"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."	2	2		2																					
9572	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion thatÕs why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
9584	4	"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again.

9590	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show SaengÕs determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The authorÕs choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."	1	2		2																					
9594	4	"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time Òwhen the shows meÓ. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, ÒSaeng  brokedown and wept!Ó The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the Òshow will meltÓ and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as Òyet another old friendÓ. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."	3	3		3																					
9602	4	" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."	1	1		1																					
9610	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againÓ (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."	2	2		2																					
9613	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter HibiscusÓ. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says ÒIn the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test againÓ. This shows SaengÕs desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes SaengÕs emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2

9639	4	"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. ThatÕs why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."	1	1		1																					
9642	4	"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. Ò ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."	1	2		2																					
9644	4	"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, itÕs the end of the story so itÕs a good way to end it because itÕs the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and itÕs short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. ItÕs not like most endings to a story so itÕs unique. Because most stories arenÕt about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."	0	0		0																					
9654	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didnÕt do good on the test the first time.

She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says ÒIn the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."	2	2		2																					
9669	4	"In Ò@CAPS1 HibiscusÓ by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. ÒAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.Ó She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. Òalmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Ó To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. ÒShe found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.Ó She canÕt say home because home isnÕt hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotionÕs all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"	3	3		3																					
9672	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1

9700	4	"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was ÒMadagascar periwinkleÓ in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flowerÕs significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."	2	2		2																					
9711	4	"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says ÒNot like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, ÒÉ and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "	2	2		2																					
9712	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1		1																					
9718	4	"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that Òwhy they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againÓ (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."	1	1		1																					
9724	4	In the story Òwinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says Òlet me help mother.Ó This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show SaengÕs commitment.	2	3		3

Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driverÕs test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, ÒThat, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?Ó Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,ÓÉin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Õ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam.

The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you.

9832	4	"The author ends the story with Òwhen they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2

Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation.

Also even knew she moved to a new country doesnÕt mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, Òbut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.Ó thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
9923	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
9932	4	"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."	1	2		2																					
9939	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesnÕt have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldnÕt be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
9940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2

ÒAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.Ó I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life."	1	1		1																					
9949	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2

9952	4	"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driverÕs test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."	2	2		2

9960	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story.

That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
9966	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story.

9981	4	" In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her Ò gentle grandmotherÓ from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story ÒWinter Hibiscus Ò with the paragraph selected."	3	2		3

And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept Ò(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother.

10338	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons.

When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. ÒPlants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.Ó This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, ÒHow strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. ÒThis symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold monthsÓ.

Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam.

The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldnÕt help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, ÒI-I failed the test.Ó When she says Òthe testÓ she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it.

The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, Òwhen the snow melts and the geese return,Ó this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, Òand this hibiscus buddingÓ she is saying when everything comes to life and is at itÕs highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence.

Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."	2	3		3																					
10440	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
10447	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel ÒA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung SaengÕs eyes now swept over herÓ. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."	2	2		2																					
10449	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come backÉ and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
10470	4	"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it.

After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time sheÕll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time.

To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."	3	3		3																					
10484	4	"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show SaengÕs determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasnÕt a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."	1	2		2

10491	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again.

10496	4	"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.

I stongly agree with this statement because if you didnÕt have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them.

ÒIts flowers arenÕt as pretty, but itÕs strong enough to make it through the cold months hereÉÓ is what SaengÕs mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states ÒÉshe realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had becomeÉalmost familiar to her now.Ó Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.

To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home.

10592	4	"The author of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driverÕs test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (ÒÉand this hibiscus is buddingÉÓ), the author depicts SaengÕs change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driverÕs test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts SaengÕs new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, SaengÕs mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (ÒÉwhen the snow melts and the geese returnÉÓ). This shows SaengÕs development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."	3	3		3																					
10604	4	"The author of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "	3	3		3

For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."	1	1		1

When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."	1	2		2																					
10620	4	"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolizeÕs how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."	2	1		2																					
10628	4	"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, ÒI just stared at the hibiscus,Ó this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother.

""satelites that crcle the earth can monitor a lot of land at once. they can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, etc,"" writes the author. ""people can use this information to improve the way we produce and distribut food."" to me, this is the best reason to continue to pay for space exploration. this benefit will help incredibly in the future, and so the money spent on it isn't too much. finally, space exploraion is avery important and very much worth the money spent on it. it can help with health, new inverntions, better technology, and can even help stop hunger and poverty. it helps life on earth, today, tommorow, and in many years to come. el fin"	8	7		2				2	2	2	2			2	1	2	2

""nearly half of all americans also have difficulty paying for housing, food, and medicine, at some point in their lives."" another reason why they shouldn't go into space. do you know why that happens? because the government slowly builds up prices, ripping people off, giving all our money to scientists. so why should we let them continue.

18159	7	"the question is should we pay 19 billion dollar for space exploration, 670 billion dallar on defense, 70 billion dollar on education, or 6.2 billion to clean pollution. each of these idea help the world a lot but there are stuff we just canÕt afford to lose. we need to use our money on stuff that are cheap and help everyone not just one state. i believe that we should not use our money on space or any of those thing except for the pollution cleaning. my reasoning are is that the cheapest one out of all, and does a lot of work. cleaning the pollution helps poverty since people who are poor buy medicine because of diseases but a lot of the diseases are caused by dirty and filthy land and pollution by doing what we earned and even made profit. i also feel that the space exploration is like a gamble. if we go to space and we canÕt find resources we lose money and that wouldnÕt be good but if we clean the air and donÕt have pollution its 100% chance it will work. iÕm not saying we shouldnÕt put money in it at all iÕm just saying itÕs not the right time. as we all know diffferent people may have different opinion and will problaby disagree in what i said/wrote. they might think itÕs can help many things like what the page over there said it can help with airplane, better weather forecasting, and many more. since they think getting better at weather forecasting it would be better for but the world is unpredictable and nothing can be perfect even if we pay for the most expensive stuff in this world theres alway going to be flaws like cleaning the pollution. iÕm pretty sure we wonÕt be able to clean all of it. at the end of the day, i still think cleaning our pollution is way more better than putting way more money to something we can think about later but pollution kill a lot of people each day and should be stop immediatly. people donÕt deserve to die because of other people be dirty not everyone will agree with me but i will still have my opinion."	9	9		1				2	2	2	3			3	2	2	2

18252	7	"space exploration space exploration is not everyone's first priority on the world's ""to-do"" list. in fact, space exploration isn't many people's. world poverty is, and that is why i'm writing this essay. i do not believe we should be spending as much money (19 billion dollars) on space exploration. i think we should spend that money on world poverty and hunger. maybe space exploration could help us to find a new planet to live on in the future, but that could take years. if we solve our world problems now, we could quit looking for a new planet to live on and stay on earth. i also think that with helping the other countries there won't be world wars, there will be world peace. we could pay back all the countries that we borrowed money from to try and pay our 3 trillion dollars in debt. if we pay back all our money, we could end the wars in afghanistan and iraq. in addition, i think we could use the 19 billion dollars to help people all around the world. god brought us in this world for one reason, one dystany, but we only got one chance. we could give the people in need, what they need, for example bed nets. they only cost 5$ dollars, and the u.s. spends 19 billion dollars on space exploration. we are grredy, we have way too much! in conclusion, i think that space exploration is not neccesary. we need to be helpful and solve the world's problems before space exploration and if we have money left, we can maybe think of new innovations, or we could go into space once again!"	6	8		1				2	2	1	1			2	2	2	2								
18255	7	"space exploration is desirable even when there is so much stuff to do on earth. it would be a cheep investment. it would also help people down on earth. last it would prevent wars. as argued in the article space travel is cheap compared to everything else. currently space travel only takes up 1.2 of the national budget. space exploration could also lead to more resources. examples include mineing astroides, finding more life, and the creation of cleaner technologys. secondly space travel could help people on earth in many ways. it could moniter weathe and crops. last space travel could prevent war, but it can also start them. for example orbital kenetic weapons platforms such as stalin's fist concept. and also a spaceship crashing in a dencely populated area. i leave you with that though"	9	11		1				2	2	2	3			3	3	2	3								
18266	7	i think that we should give more money for space exploration. the author convinced me that it is worth it. some reasons i that i think we should fund space exploration is because one space give us better forecast. so saying that we would be ready for a storm or something. another reason is space exploration helps us figure out medical medicines. the nasa also helps us learn about how our body works under stress. the third reason why i think we should keep funding space exploration is that they made life better for us here on earth. yea people and poverty is sad but there is no way we can stop it. space exploration should be funded in my opionion. good-bye :) :p <3 :)	12	9		1				3	3	3	3			3	2	2	2								
18281	7	"the author has convinced me that ""space exploration is desirable when there is so much that needs to be done on earth"". space exploration has been proven to help or benefit our society as well as our planet. more advanced machines technologies, and medicine are all the right reasons to invest in space exploration. over the years, scientists have come up with new ideas, that in result, have created better machinery. according to an article, ""these include better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting"". these are all important advancements produced just from traveling to space. with the exception of making advancements in machinery, technology has much improved in result of space exploration. all of the major advancements in technology were created by nasa engineers to make space travel possible. satellites have been a big help in defeating the issue of poverty. the satellites circle around the earth, monitoring lots of land at once. the satellites measure the condition of many things having to do with soil and drop growth. in an article, it says ""they can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, etc."" this citation from the article confirms the fact that people can use this information to improve the way food is distributed and produced. aside from making huge improvements in technology, medicine has proved to excel in the past years as well. the exploration of space has led to useful needed improvements, such as the area of medicine. before astronauts were allowed to go on missions, scientists has a difficult time monitoring their health. thanksfully, later on medical instruments were developed and doctor's learned more about the human body. in the article, it states ""this was to ensure the safety of the astronauts under harsh conditions, like those why would experience on launch and return"". this citation justifies the fact that doctors sought further education pertaining to their field, to ensure the health and safety of astronauts. the author has persuaded me into believeing space exploration is desirable. space exploration has been the reason for the many advancements made in medicine, machines, and different technologies. if it weren't for space exploration, we wouldn't be where we are now, as far as knowledge and medicine. if the exploration of space is one of the major things needed to find answers to other problems, i say we go for it."	12	12		3				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
18282	7	"i am convinced that space exploring is desireable even if there is a lot to do on earth. in space, the satillites revolting around earth can detect crops and their current status this could tell people how to improve the conditions and produce better crops and distribute them to people who are undernouished. 19 million isn't that much compared to the 670 million the us spent on defense. if we're able to take some of that amount and use it for education, people can learn better, they can also take courses regarding defending one self or learn how to use a weapon. space exploring is important. this way, astronauts can learn more about the planets and the space. this way, astronauts can know which planets can maintain life and has water and air."	10	10		1				3	3	2	2			2	3	2	3								
18283	7	"i think that we should fund space exploration. i have this because for the past couple of years we are constantly trying to make earth a better environment for us to live. we spend over billions of dollars on important things like national defense, education, and renewable or clean energy source. space exploration can help solve problems with the technology we have now. there can be certain problems we have to care about, but some we can solve by using space. in the text, it mentions that ""nasa scientist have developed other innovations that have improved our lives."" this is true. without constant changes on earth, we wouldn't know what will earth look like a couple years later. we can choose what kind of like do we want to live. we use satellites to determine what the weather is going to be. according to the text, the satellites circle on orbit around the earth can monitor lots of land at once. they can track and measure what kind of condition of crops, rainfall, drought, storm, and much more. with satellites we can see what happens all around the world. there might be problems of starvation and poverty all around the world, we can still see what we need to do to help them. so the final conclusion is that i think that we should fund space exploration. nasa can help improve the way we live."	8	12		2				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3								
18286	7	"space exploration i think that we should and should not be doing space exploration, even if we have many things to do here on earth that are really important to do. my opinion is that if the government wants to have space exploration more than using the money for other specific and important purposes that is their problem, because maybe one day even the government might run out money for space exploration. first, some people believe that having space exploration is a bad idea. one reason why many people oppose to this is because they say they over 46.2 million americans now live in poverty. that's like 15% of the american population. another reason is that not just us as humans need the money but also our earth its self.  earth is getting damaged by all the fuels, and oils used for things like space exploration, it is also harming our air and oceans. last, people against space exploration say that the government is using 19 billion dollars per year just for space exploration. people believe they should use that money for things more important and beneficial to earth, and to everyone. on the other hand, many people believe having space exploration can be really beneficial. one reason why people are in favor of space exploration is because they say that 19 billion dollars isn't even a lot of money. 19 billion dollars is only 1.2% of the total national budget. another reason people are in favor of this, is because they say nasa has improved out lives by developing new and better exercise machines, airplanes, and weather forecasting. in conclusion, i believe that the government should decide wheter they want to have space exploration or not, but they should remember that there isn't gonna be enough money if they waste it on only one thing. i think it is up to the government to decide what would be better, not just to them, nut to all humans, and earth."	12	8		2				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	2								
18290	7	"i believe that we should continue space exploration because it can help our society. this helps us all around the world and it being done now it can also help us in the future. one reason why we should continue is so we can develop new technology. we also use it for creative thinking. for example, we use sattelites to detect our forcast and for seeing how crops are growing around the world. another reason is that we don't even use that much money. people think the 9 billion dollars isn't alot since it's only 1.2% of the national budget. compare to how much we spend to u.s. national defense which takes up 26.3% of the budget. finally, space exploration stopped us of going into a bomb dropping war with russia. we are having a contest to get to the moon faster, this is better because we aren't going into another war with an another country. this also helps us find new planets. in conclusion, space exploration is a very helpful for developing dreams, peace, and creative idea. all of us should care for our country, our world. we must find ourselves to evolutionize."	4	6		2				1	1	1	1			2	2	1	1								
18291	7	"well i think what the article said about we going to space is true because if one day the earth explodes we can make a new world in another planet. the first evidence is that if we have a new planet to live on. second evidence is that we can live bigger in another planet. last evidence is that itÕs more good for us because we live longer. but in the other side itÕs bad because there wasting 19 billion dollars just for putting a satellite and sending people to space. rather than spending 19 billion dollars in sending people to space we should spend it on medioation, education, better homes, etc. also just because you waste 19 billion dollars on space some other people need the money because there dieying because of diesieses and because they donÕt have food. they just care about war, and sending people to space."	11	11		1				3	3	2	3			3	3	2	3								
18296	7	"space exploration. why are you against it? its like a kid playing a sport. they will begin to fall behind on education but who knows? it could help us in the future, and as far as i'm concerned it has been helping us. without the project on space we would have never had so much progress not only in math but in science as well. there is nothing wrong with it it barely takes up 2% of the national budget. also if we did stop space exploration what would 19 billion do to 46.2 americans? it wouldn't help them by much. even though i agree the air and oceans are polluted it does not mean that is was all space exploration's fault. have you ever though that there was all of us to blame? think about all the children who loves space and dream of being an astronomer? do you really want to crush them and all the people who are famous for what they have done? the future generation would never get to hear about them and their deeds. for example, galileo was a famous astronomer and physicist. for all he done his name should be heard everywhere. what would happen if you were to take it away? what i find most surprising is that you think 19 billion is a lot. compared to 670 billion it is nothing. many would lose their job and the economy would be at an even greater downfall. think about nasa and what they have done. sure they might be a little off when it come to predicting what will happen to the world but its not like they arent trying. think about all our progress they made with the 8 planets and the stars. obviously space exploration should go on. it not that expensive and it really improve our economy. this is my opinion of why i think space exploration should go on. it will not do much harm and instead it will help what our earth is now. the future awaits us, we just need to see what is going to happen."	4	4		1				1	1	1	1			1	1	1	1								
18301	7	"in my opinion, space exploration is necessary. space exploration requires a large amount of money, but many people agee that the money is going to a good cause. space exploration is needed on earth for many important reasons. one reason why space exploration is necessary is because new medicines are discovered when people go on missions to space. in an article, it stated Òbefore nasa allowed astronauts to go on missions, scientists had to find ways to monitor their health under stressful conditions. in doing this, medical instruments were developed and doctors learned about the human bodyÕs reaction to stress.Ó without the medicine, some people wouldnÕt be alive now. medicine is one of the important factors in life that people canÕt live without it. another reason why space exploration is important is because of the many new inventions that were made! the author of an article clearly states, Òin rising to meet the challenges of space exploration, nasa scientists have developed other innovations that have improved our lives. these include better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting.Ó if there wasnÕt any explorations to space, then we wouldnÕt have airplanes. without airplanes, humans wouldnÕt be able to travel to a far place to visit their friends or family. some people might think that the large amount of money used for space travels should be used to make the earth a better place. but space exploration does make the world a better place! the author of the same article mentioned, Òsatellites that circle earth can monitor lots of land at once. they can track and measure the conditions of crop, soil, rainfalls, droughts, etc.Ó by having satellites, we can know when the weather is good for growing crops so that humans wonÕt starve. space exploration is really more important than you think. sure, it uses a lot of money, but the money is to a good cause! without space travel, we wouldnÕt have the world weÕre living in today."	6	8		3				2	2	1	1			2	2	2	2								
18304	7	"i am very convinced that we should invest more money in space exploration. firstly, it provides a distraction for destruction. as it is stated in the article, there is already an example set for us in 1960. during the Òcold warÓ, the us competed with russia to prove their greatness. also, space exploration led to significant improvement in every day technology. these include better exercise machines, more advanced airplanes, & more specific weather forecasts. but the most important point was exploring outer space led to progress in education. with better education, i believe the human race will be ever more intelligent. therefore, with more knowledge, we will be able to solve problems such as starvation & the spread of disease. thus proving that Òspace exploration is desirable when there is so much that needs to be done on earth.Ó"	7	6		2				0	2	2	3			0	2	2	2

18466	7	"why we should fund space exploration the author didn't persuade me on anything. i already had my mind set on this, although the author had persuasive points on both sides of the arguement. n.a.s.a. is only funded on 19 billion dollars, thats 1.2% of the entire national budget its nothing compared to how much the government spends on education, renewable energy, or national government. most people argue we could help the earth and people who are lethal disiesas, but why don't other countries do that? if they sound selfish to think that other countries could help the whole continent of africa stop the spread malaria by funding for some nets. nasa also helps creates inventions to better peoples lives, such as excercise machines, better aircrafts and satellites that improve weather forecasting. so obviously these things are bought so the money goes back to the economy via taxes. so nasa basically pays for itself.  many people may argue that this would ruin the earth but the government is already finding cleaner ways to replace the use of fossil fuels. 6.3 billion dollars from the united states national budget is used for renewable energy sources. finally unknown exploration for the most part is a good thing. imagine if christopher columbus was denied the funding from spain and never crossed the atlantic and found the america's. this ignited a competitive spirit within all the western european countries. sweden, finland, netherlands, france, spain, and england all set out to this unknown land. although this is know such a common piece of land it used to be an unknown territory. well uncharted by ""modern"" people. this competitive spirit lived on when president nixon wanted to put a man on the moon, so did the russian prime minister. the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. had a great race to the moon. u.s. won and for now the spirit lies dormont, but if we keep exploring space we might find that spirit again. so we should fund nasa. to find asteroid threats. inventions that could be bought and function in any house-hold to help the economy. and to find another ""great race"" for all the nations to participate in."	5	7		2				1	1	2	1			2	2	1	2

18490	7	"the author who wrote this has convinced me that we should fund space exploration. there is enough evidence to show that it is worth 19 billion dollars to fund space exploration. even though there are problems on earth, space exploration can help with some of those problems. one of the points the author brings up is that ""space exploration costs 19 billion dollars."" at first that seams like a lot, but compared to the 670 billion dollars spent on military defense, 70 billion dollars on educations, or 6.3 billion dollars spent on clean energy it isn't much. therefore funding the space exploration doesn't cost so much. this is the first reason the author convinced me. the second point that the author brings up is that some people on earth are sick, homeless, have no medical care, or donÕt have acces to simple solutions that can save lives. for example, a quote from the article is ""in africa there is disease call malari, spread by mosquito bites, that kills many people. this could be prevented by a net for $5, but some can't afford it."" people says that we should use 19 billion dollars to help the people. although space exploration could help these people. one way, according to the article, is that space exploration helps in the area of medicine. nasa moniter and finds way to help people under stress. this helps doctors learn about the human body. sattities could help with hunger, it tracks and moniters a large of land with crops. this could help to understand how to produced and distribute crops. the last reason that convinced me is that, space exploration helps education. for example, the author said that ""during the cold war, the us and russia had complete to see who can explore space first."" we wont that race and it help lead to significant investmnet and progress in american education, especially in math and science. in conclusion, the author has convince me that we should fund space exploration. even though it cost 19 billion dollars, it isn't much compared to the amount of money we use on other things. space exploration helps with midicine, food, and education. this why the author has convinced me that we should fund space exploration."	8	6		3				2	2	2	2			1	2	1	2								
18492	7	"i think that space funding should, if anything, be larger. space is a new frontier. we know so little about it, and for all we know there could be a miracle cure for everything on earth. another good reason for space exploration is motivation. if we get people on mars, or even the moon again, any country would be motivated to solve problems. landing on another planet would make everything else seem easy compared to it. so the people who want to take money from nasa think they need it for funding food and other things for the poor. why don't the just take it from religons funding i am sorry to whoever is reading this, if you are religious. but we spend over 50 billion dollar on the church every year, and what has religion done for us? well it dragged europe into the dark ages. prayers really never come to happen, and if god was so kind why are people starving? nasa is helping the country, religion is not. or, you could take it from the national defense budget. we spend more on our military than the next countries combined. so over all, i do not think we should stop nasa. if we need funding for anti poverty, get it elsewhere. space exploration is a good thing. it teaches us so much."	8	9		0				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

'murican government stop wasting money on unecessary stuff. seriously wasting our money on weapons, no. plus the gas prices are too darn high! like gas prices, space equpment are expensive too. space equipment cost 19billion dollars! what the heck, but 670 billion is spent by the u.s, only 7 billion is spent by the government for school, seriously nodding my head in dissapointment cause of this. they are taking our money! we shall fight for the hobbits and elfs and our people! we will destroy mordor! so i suggest money should be spent on something helpful. like the environment. pollution is a big problem. we can die. or we can plant more trees. what really pisses me off is how people cutt down trees."	5	7		0				1	1	1	2			2	2	2	1

Òsatellites that circle around the earth can monitor lots of land at once.Ó this is another quote that supports my assertion that space exploration is worth it and useful. the satellite can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought etc. it helps people to solve serious problem on earth. nasa can find ways to stop bad problems on earth by just using the satellite. that is why space exploration is important. information collected from the satellite, does it help us on whatÕs hapening on earth? yes it does, for example if you study the earthÕs land it can help produce and distribute food easily, cause when you study the land form you will know whatÕs right or wrong to grow crops for people to eat. you can also learn a faster way to get and grow crop even faster for the need of food. nasa the space exploration improved our lives by building better airplanes and other vehicles etc. it helped us by transporting people or other thing from one place to another faster and easier. it can also help us on stopping pollution from reaching to our atmosphere. for example nasa finds a way to make vehicles that can move without oil or gasoline like electrical cares. these are all the evidence that supports my assertion that space exploration is important and how it can improve our lives. it also helps us improve our country. one more final sentence is if you explore space you might be a amaze to learn about whats in space."	4	8		2				1	1	1	1			2	2	2	2

18721	7	"the author of this article did not convince me that space exploration is a worth cause for the national government to fund. many of the arguments brought up by the author in favor of space exploration were not entirely valid points of information. one argument that the author brings up is that the amount of the national buget spent on space exploration is 19 billion dollars; our sun that they claim is 'small'. however that is still money that could be speant on other things such as education. i think that it is more important  for the government to spend money on taking care of issues that are more prominent on earth, rather than look at other, unihabitable planets. another issue that arrives in conjunction with this argument is a matter of national priority. the author argues that space exploration has lead to many innovations in the fields of medicine, exersize equipment and weather forcasting. while this is all true that does not mean space exploration was directly responsible for these inventions. these discoveries could have been made by other scientists who did not work directly with nasa. a good point the author brings up is that there are other problems on earth that need solving. issues such as poverty, a lack of health care, and hunger are all very real issues in the world. instead of wasting money trying to send people into space the government should be trying to solve these problems in certain places, such as africa, as little as $5 can help improve someone's life. the final point that the author brings up is that space exploration can be a means by which countries can solve their differences. they reference the cold war and how soviet russia and the united states quickly began a compitition of sorts to be the first country to send people to the moon. however the ignore the entire origin of this time in history. it was, in fact, russia who first sent a satalite into space, the united states belived that this satalite would be used to spy on america or even drop bombs. this worried the government to the point where they in turn sent a satalite into space and then began to work on the apollo 13 mission. while no actual warfare did originate from a fear that space could be used as a weapon of war. in conclusion space exploration is not a valid use of the national buget. it takes away far to much from more useful things such as education and poverty without supplying much in return. if space exploration is to continue it must either cease using so much of public money or offer more substatal benifits."	7	8		3				1	2	2	2			2	1	2	3

18910	7	"i feel that space exploration is worth the immediate investment, it has significant benefits to the people. the needs on earth can be met through the innovation in space travel, as one problem's potential solutions often lead to other solutions. as for the cost to the people, it seems barely significant compared to the extremely effensive military spending and expenditure, especially when we are not in a state where we are actively waging war. the spending that totals over one quarter of the united states budget seems more like stealing from the people compared to the mittances allocated to education and space travel. the resulting technological innovations are another obvious affect to the costs, there were medical and technological advances from the space program that improved the quality of life. should these innovations be used in conjunction with new discoveries. we could have the potential to eliminate some ailments of society, such as famine, dehabilitating disease, and oppressment of the people. if we couple that with redirection of military spending, the poor and aflicted could be given better services and care, or even simple tools to improve their quality of life. the military is, again, the most severe drain on the country's resources. granted, we should have a military, but there is no need for it to be so large when there are higher priorities than warfare. also, as times before have shown, diverting resources into space exploration prevents the need for military spending, as no major countries will actually be focusing towards warfare. if we concentrate our efforts into exploration, war becomes a lesser issue. the environment is another concern raised. however, should there be funding into cleaner, more accessable fuel sources, the innovations could help to alleviate the problem while also opening new options for fueling our space craft. thus, it we are to both reduce our military spending, and join efforts with our demilitarized countries, we can produce many advances to all fields of science, continuing exploration while benefitting the people."	8	12		2				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

19135	7	"one reason why we shouldn't fund space exploration is because with the money they spend for that, they could buy a ton of bed netting that would be needed for people in africa, and less people would get malaria. even with the extra money that they didn't use they could help with some people who were having money problems and try to help them with it. plus with the money that they didn't use they could use it for a different cause. they could use it for a new research to buy and help figure out away to save the oceans. try to clean it up better so the animals would live longer reasons why they should fund the space exploration is because when they put up the satellites it moves around the earth monitoring what might happen next for the weather and looking to see how crops on farms are doing, and how the sod is also. and they don't us as much money the do on school education. for school education they use 70 billion dollars on building schools and buying all the books. and spending them all on extra classes. for the space exploration, they would only use 19 billion dollars, on all the equipment they had, and on the people who were going to space. other reasons why they should fund space exploration is that when people go up to space they could see how the weather is doing on earth and if there is something wrong then they could tell nasa what the problem is and they would try to figure it our and have so solve it. so basically i would say that they should fund for space exploration so that maybe they could help the earth when it is needed and se that they could try and stop all of these messes that have been happening on earth."	4	5		1				1	1	1	1			1	1	1	2								
19147	7	in my opinion the author did not convince me to not fund space exploration. i think this because we have benefited from space exploration. we get news from satelites in space. we also get weather reports from satelites in space. like the auther stated only 1.2% of the national budget is used for space exporation. its little compared to the 26.3% of the national budget the us uses for national defense. sure we have a lot of problems on earth to solve but there are people that are helping improve that. like in africa people are doneting nets to protect the people from catching melaria. to conclude there are already people working to solve problems on earth. only 1.2% of the national budget goes to space exploration. we also get benefits from space satellites. space exploration should be funded.	8	7		1				2	2	2	2			2	2	1	2

19168	7	space exploration is worth the cost. people believe 19 million dollars isn't that much. for example we spend 70 million dollars for education and 760 million dollars for military expenses. space exploration has led to many tangible benefits. it has helped doctors in the area of medicine. doctors created heart monitors to see peoples stress. medical instruments were also developed to help people with stress. medically space exploration has helped us alot. problems with hunger also are tackled by space exploration. they can track weather which helps out crops. it helps the way we produce and distribute food.	8	8		0				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
19169	7	"based on the text, i don't think "" space exploration is desirable"" because, there is a lot of things that need to be done on earth. i don't think the government needs to spend 19 billion dollars a year on space exploration because it desirable the government needs to be focused on people. some people lost their lives because they didn't have enough money to afford medical care and they couldn't get clean water. space exploration might be desirbale but people lossing their lives is more important to spend all that money on every year. it didn't convince me because the people in africa i think is more important because they get but by mosquito's in their sleep and they can't do anything about it because it cost $5 to get a net to cover where they sleep so they won't get bitten but they can't afford it and the disease is spreading and many people are suffering from it. another reason i don't think ""space exploration is desirable'' because, the pollution from burning fossils fuels is harming the ocean and air and all that pollution is gasoline and oil. the pollution can maybe be harming the earth because the chemicals from gasoline and oil is not good to inhale. the last reason that the government shouldn't be spending all this money on space exploration is that problems of hunger and poverty can get messed up because of the space exploration. satellites might be able to help because when they circle the earth they can monitor the land and track also measure the condition for crops, soil, rainfall, and drought to try to feed the hungry people."	9	10		1				2	2	2	3			2	3	2	3

19193	7	"i don't think the author convinced me that space exploration is desirable when there is so much that need to be done on earth. going to space is not that helpful for earth because they waste money, killing enviroment and people. space heave alot to explore but we went there plenty of time but we still find the same thing. people on earth are suffering because people spent too much money on space explorations. if the nasa can use the money on health and medical thing, we can still have more lives on earth. indeed, over 46.2 millions of american live in poverty. 50% of the america can't even afford housing, food, and sometimes health. things like this happen because people used too much money on space exploration. there used to be 19 billion dollars, thats 1.2% of the national budget! they used the money just to explore space. what if they didn't find any solutions, that means they wasted all that money for nothing. so, they should just use the money on making medicine on earth. the u.s. spent 670 billions dollars on defense because the whole country might collapsed without defense. 70 billions on education can be useful because education is the most important thing for kinds. while going on space exploration is not really helpful. the scientist on earth can invent things without going to space. the astronaut might not have a chance finding medicines. finally, people should spent money on space exploration. it wasted money that should be used to something useful like education and health care. there's no point of going to space now if the things are just going to stay there. the space is not going to be gone. we can make everyone healthy on earth before going space exploration!"	8	9		2				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3								
19211	7	"i don't think the author really convince me. after all, what's the point of weather tracking satellites if you can't do much besides whats going to happen next? the satellite can't stop a hurricane heading to new york or a drought in the farm. i give the weather tracking satellites props for saving people's lives but what about the lives after the disaster? also another reason why we should cut funding is the poverty level and 1 in 6 people live in poverty in the u.s. but you say 19 billion is not alot. also, half of all americans have money problems sometime in their lives. we should spend that 19 billion a year on the people instead of a unmanned satellite that will stay in space, give us nice pictures, and then eventually burn up. another reason why we should cut funding is global warming, the earth is warming up. a lot of people live near the sea. if the ice melted, the ocean will rise and kill them what's the point of exploring space if there's no one to do the exploring. also, you only spend 6.5 billion dollers on clean energy. that's less than 1% of the budget! one last reason is about the people in africa. people there are dying of malaria every day, but america doesn't buy them $5 nets. instead, they spend a whole lot of money to send satellites to space to watch the desert. this is why i'm not convinced by the writer and want to stop funding the space program."	11	8		1				3	3	2	3			2	2	2	2

19223	7	"i think we should continue because it can help us get new medical instruments and the satelites in space can track when the rain will fall and if the soil is good. space exploration only cost 19 billion dollars which is only 1.2% of the governments budget. it may sound a lot but only 1.2% is used for space exploration. 1.2% is not a lot, out of 100% 19 billion dollars is not alot of money. and the space exploration can help benefit us in the future. i think space exploration cost the lowest out of all the things that the government use it's money on. they use 670 billion dollars on national defense, which is only 26.3% of the budget. and 70 billion dollars on school, and 6.3 billion dollars on clean energy. so if they keep using money on the space exploration, i think it will all be worth it in the future. because it can lead to bigger causes in the future. space exploration helps solves some problems like food, water, technology, and medical instruments. some people may say that it is a waste of money but some people think  that if we get new technology and medical instruments it can help benefit many problems that the earth faces everday. and if we use new technology from space exploration we can help make clean energy. and if we use new medical instruments then doctors can save even more lives, and maybe make people live longer. and space exploration helps educate people, specifically in math, and science. they help educate people even more because it means they live looking foward to try and be good at knowing about space, more than an average teacher teaches about space. space exploration can help inspire people to want to learn more about space exploration so that they all try to do it themselves. so when they fund for space exploration they are also helping things solve some very serious problems on earth ""little"" by little. but it will take some time to finally take down the problems we and the earth face every day. when we finally solve the problems on earth and in peoples lives they wont live in poverty anymore because 46.2 millions americans live in poverty and almost half are having problems trying to pay for food, clean water, and medical expenses. so when people  say that space exploration is bad for the earth then what if they engineer new inventions to help make the earth a little bit healthier, even if it is going to take some time. people have all the time they need to wait for the earth to get healthier because of the space exploration. if people get problems from space exploration they can wait until its over and then they might get money from the government because the 1.2% of the money that they used for space exploration can be funded into something for poverty because space exploration uses ours. that is why i think they should keep funding for space exploration. we can just wait for good things to happen."	8	12		2				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3								
19224	7	"before this article, i was for the author's side, but i felt that if i was for the environment side i would stay on that side. it seemed that the author had a week/ flawed argument, but besides that i am still for more funding for space travel. a strong argument for the funding is the amount of money nasa is sominiscule that the u.s in fact says about 35 more times for military spending than space travel. 35 times, with 19 billion dollars nasa has been finding scientific break throughout about every month. the military doesn't need 670 billion dollars. so they say kids need mosquito nets so say the government gave that program 19 billion dollars, what would happen? they would have way too much money because they don't need 20 billion dollars. 1 million dollars a give 200,000 nets. i believe that we need to focus more on space travel because one day we will not have earth, as a result of global warming. even if we have cleaner forms of energy we will not be 100% green in 5 years. earth will become inhabitable and then how will humans survive? space travel. nasa does not just work on space travel, they work on aerodynamics, gravity and stress control. therefore benifiting humans with more innovation inventions, and creations. in conclusion i believe that author didn't convince me either way. but i covered with some main points in the article overall. i believe strongly that space travel is worth funding,"	5	8		1				1	2	1	1			2	2	2	2

19233	7	"i think we should only sometimes fund for the space exploration. because sometime you don't really need the space exploration, because someother paces, like marlaria need the funds/money for nets. they need the nets because the malaria people couldn't afford it even it cost only 5.00. i also think that space exploration is nor that diserable but, a big art of the planet earth, but sometimes we need it for education, renewable (cleaned) energy and national defense. the funds can divide into each groups that need money - for example donations for different places that can't afford medicines, clothes, and supplies. people had died because of diseases - for example coldness, the mosquitos bites and other tragic disease. other money/fund can be for other activities (it you have extra funds left), you also use the extra for space exploration. sometimes it is diserable for space exploration. you can explore the galaxy(ies) and see the rings and textures of the (other) planets, you could also visited the moon, but most of the times the money/funds are for need societies and communities. some of the money belongs to the government, so they are incharge of whether it should be used correctly. encourage people to help other by donating money and funds, otherwise you can donate needed item like clothes and technology (if it's possible). and so could help by spreading it around. and finally, i think that everything should be the right amount of funds. i also think that the space exploration should be open 5-8 times a year sot it some money for the other."	9	9		0				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3

(malaria is a disease spread by mosquitos bites) some may say that technology can help build organic fuel. but i would say it would cost alot of money and research thirdly, in my own perspective people shouldn't argue about this problem because in this world people just follow the leader nothing else. because in one side. they want to help and get the people out of poverty but one side will want to go explore other planets to find suitable planets but so really there isnt much to it. some people may say that space exploration is or isn't important but ""i disagree with this because space exploration improved technology though the cost of repairing, emprove mems and other thing cost alot of money. in conclusion to end this essay i would like to say that space exploration is important though being against it is still important."	9	9		1				3	3	2	1			3	3	2	1

But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for."	1	1		1

Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3

Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building.

In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock.

One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through.

Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3		3

On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below."	2	2		2																					
14960	6	"In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted it gives information of the potential problems from the Mast. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling."" The builders had a lot to take in to effect they had height issues, frame and law issues. That they had to sort out."	3	2		3																					
14967	6	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished."	4	3		4																					
14974	6	"There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp."	3	3		3																					
14992	6	"Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state."	3	3		3																					
14995	6	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."	3	4		4																					
15001	6	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely."	3	3		3																					
15003	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take to long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems."	1	1		1

People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles."	3	3		3																					
15015	6	"The obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.

15024	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people."	3	2		3

Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas.

15089	6	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe.""

Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring.

15159	6	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made."	3	3		3																					
15164	6	"Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At @CAPS1 the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over @MONEY1 to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in @CAPS2 this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped."	3	3		3																					
15165	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible"	3	3		3																					
15169	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow  dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15170	6	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building."	2	3		3																					
15175	6	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire state Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" @CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The wind s on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled."	2	2		2																					
15182	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2 it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the Architect working on the Empire State Building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost @MONEY1 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldnt use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. In the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished."	3	4		4																					
15185	6	the obstacles the builder of the empire state Building faced were... When the were planning to build a mask for the Dirigibles. When they first tried to build it they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mask. The Empire State building had to souport both the mask and the Dirigibles. Then at the end of the story the figured out there was no way to do it. That was one of the obsticals.	1	1		1																					
15195	6	"the obstacles the builders of the empire state @CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in @LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast."	1	1		1																					
15200	6	"In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money."	3	4		4																					
15202	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.	3	2		3																					
15206	6	"One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles."	3	3		2

All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building."	3	3		3																					
15216	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe."	3	3		3																					
15219	6	"Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City"	3	3		3																					
15220	6	"In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York @CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted."	2	3		3																					
15223	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3

This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3		4

15240	6	"Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out.

15242	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (LŸsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (LŸsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach."	4	3		4

Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around.

15369	6	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"".According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. An existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. @ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast."	2	3		3																					
15370	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where difficult. One of the obstecles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea impossible to happen."	2	3		3																					
15371	6	"The architects had few problems. As said in @LOCATION1, stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for The building. They would @CAPS1 over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications. Other Then That They @CAPS2 had to redesign And then make it."	1	2		2																					
15380	6	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As LŸsted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it."	3	3		3

15387	6	"Al Smith and the engineers faced many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obsticle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and killing millions. Another obsticle they faced was mother nature, In a height like 1,250 ft, theire are incredible winds blowing, and someone even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Findly, the law prohibites the dirigible to be ""flying too low over urban areas."" therefore doing this would be illegal. the building faced many obstacle, it got through most of them, but in the end it would be extremly unsafe to go on with mast."	3	3		3																					
15390	6	There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. they had to pay ove sixty thousand dollars worth of modificautions in to the buildings framework.	1	2		2																					
15395	6	"When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area."	3	3		3																					
15405	6	"The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen is highley flamable so the dirigible could blow up and ingor any one aroud it. The empire state building may not be strong enough to withstand the the moving of the @CAPS1 the back side moveing so much from the dangorouse winds, so the @CAPS1 could possibly pull off part of the building and could @CAPS2 nearby pedastrians."	2	1		2																					
15407	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered."	2	2		2																					
15427	6	"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there."	3	3		3																					
15430	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	4		4																					
15433	6	"During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building."	3	3		3																					
15436	6	"The empire state building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building but many problems occured during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building the building would have to withstand its weight. ""The steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1)"" The 102 story floor building was predicted to be a success and predicted to become the new age of aviation travel. Another obsitcle that the workers faced was realizing that dirigibles outside the @CAPS1 were highly flammable because they contain hydrogen. It would be disastrous if one caught on fire on the top of the building in New York City. ""The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2).""

Having a mooring dock was a good idea but it was never really practicol or safe, many bad things could of happened if it was actually working."	4	4		4																					
15442	6	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."	2	4		2																					
15446	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
15447	6	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

15448	6	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared."	3	2		3

15465	6	"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."	3	3		3																					
15466	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose."	2	2		2																					
15474	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there."	4	4		4

With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles.

Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea.

This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds.

15559	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear.	3	2		3																					
15563	6	"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles."	1	1		1																					
15576	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation."" Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable. The builders didnt want an ""accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of Nature. With winds so strong up top the building the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 the builders go through many obstacles in building the empire state building."	4	4		4																					
15579	6	"The lack of the landing area. Also the body of the dirigible can Swing Is another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. The other obstacle they faced, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles were flying to low over the urban areas and that is a law against airships. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles could not get close enuff to tie up the dirigible do to the wind. Alot went wrong with transportation of Passengers so they stoped doing that."	2	3		3																					
15582	6	"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared."	3	3		3																					
15595	6	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15597	6	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult."	3	3		3																					
15598	6	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process in doing so they @CAPS1 many obstacles. First, obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. They really should've thought to make it bigger in the first place. Workers did work but was not enuff. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing and then they would know that wind up higher gets ruffer. Bacicaly should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were ney laws which there was; Also, all that work for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders @CAPS2 were things that could have been prevented, so money and time did not have went to waste."	3	2		3																					
15606	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. They faced way to many problems."	3	2		3																					
15608	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent."	3	2		3																					
15613	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obsticles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast."	3	3		3																					
15625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low."	2	2		2																					
15636	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo."	1	0		1																					
15638	6	They faced challanges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. There was really no safe way to do it. They also sayed the gas that keeps it floating is highly flamable. So it was like one big safty concern.In reality they ended up realizing its too dangerouse for them to do. If they took the chance and something went wrong innocent people could die.	2	1		2																					
15642	6	"Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The buiders faces so many obstacles."	1	1		1																					
15649	6	The builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 threw many obstacles. They consulted with experts taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The builders also had to meet with the president of a formed airship transport company.	1	1		1																					
15650	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing. New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
15653	6	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3																					
15657	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15658	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4		4																					
15659	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome"	3	3		3																					
15660	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground."	2	2		2																					
15661	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Also ""Dirigibles were docked by which means of an winch, @CAPS1 thats what they did and faced to dock there."	1	0		1																					
15674	6	" There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (LŸsted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense."	4	3		4																					
15686	6	"Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didnt work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected. This is why the idea always stayed a dream."	2	3		3																					
15692	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon LŸsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."	4	4		4

One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¦ @NUM3).

They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong.

15784	6	"Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning."	2	3		3																					
15786	6	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse."	3	3		3																					
15791	6	"In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face."	1	1		1																					
15793	6	"The obstacles that the builder's faced were @CAPS1 avoidable. The first obsticle they faced was the @CAPS2 landing space they had. If they had thought a little bit longer they most likey could of figured out a way to overcome that problem. Now a @CAPS3 a couple of obsticles to talked about the fate of the Mast. Everybody including Al Smith should have thought about the safty, it Should have been a first priority. The builder's Should have seen a problem like this coming, with a poor plan to build Something @CAPS4 has everdone before."	1	1		1																					
15795	6	"The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people."	3	3		3																					
15800	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public."	3	3		3																					
15813	6	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @NUM1 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation."	3	3		3																					
15816	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" make the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform."	3	2		3																					
15817	6	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
15818	6	"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical."	2	2		2																					
15819	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3																					
15824	6	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct."	4	3		4																					
15827	6	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building."	3	4		4																					
15828	6	"well, since this one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area For the dirigibles. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line From the front of ship then tied to the Mast. But, then yet the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles load and the wind pressure would transmitte all the way to the building's Foundation. The steel Frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation."	3	2		3																					
15830	6	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3																					
15837	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly."	1	1		1																					
15840	6	"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day."	1	2		2																					
15843	6	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end."	3	3		3																					
15846	6	"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles."	4	4		4																					
15848	6	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project."	3	3		3																					
15851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1		2																					
15869	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock."	3	3		3																					
15870	6	"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. There were many obstacles the builders went through."	3	3		3																					
15872	6	"The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building."	1	1		1																					
15875	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow derigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents."	2	2		2																					
15882	6	"The Empire State Building was meant to be great The tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles."	3	2		2																					
15885	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15893	6	"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The derigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. So, neadless to say, it wouldn't work out."	3	3		3																					
15894	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and Strengthened, which was over sixty thosand dollars 'worth.

The body of the dirigibles Could Swing in the breeze, and yet passengers Could Safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State builduing."	1	0		1																					
15907	6	"The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal."	3	3		3																					
15908	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obsticales to deal with.

15914	6	"When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose."	3	2		3																					
15916	6	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat."	3	4		4																					
15917	6	"The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not notice them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem untill after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg."	1	1		1																					
15919	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. one of the obstacles were the crowded @CAPS1 they had for the dirigible. crowded @CAPS1 can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put alot of tension on the building and something could go wrong."	2	4		2																					
15926	6	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																					
15927	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory."	2	3		3																					
15934	6	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers.	1	1		1																					
15936	6	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast"	4	3		4																					
15939	6	work face many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attched to the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did become the transportation of the future. The Empire State building Never got to forfill its purposes for dirigibles.	1	0		1																					
15952	6	"In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."	4	3		4																					
15953	6	"There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success."	2	1		2																					
15957	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge acadent One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there"	4	3		3																					
15962	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself."	2	1		2																					
15968	6	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15975	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
15986	6	"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."""	1	2		2																					
15996	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the empire state building would of faced many consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A regular sized diriglbe where made of ""enormous steel framed ballons."" They went as fast as ""eighty miles per hour, and could cruise at seventy per hour. The Empire State Building's would of faced the ""building dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". And even if the dirigibe landed their the ship would ""swivel around and around"" which would of made the building more move-able. Even if the ship would land their it was ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even approach the area."	2	2		2																					
15997	6	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16006	6	"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today."	2	3		3																					
16011	6	"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flamable"". There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated. There were also whether problems. Winds were constantly shifting. ""Ship would swival around and around"". Realizing the danger, all they could do was shut it down."	2	2		2																					
16017	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."	3	3		3																					
16018	6	"Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to. The builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law agianst airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles.

Also sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frameworK.

It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast.	3	2		3																					
16047	6	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16049	6	"When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. These obstacles lead the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to. The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend @MONEY1 to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to the never useing of their mast."	3	4		4																					
16053	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building.

The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" It cost more than @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work."	4	3		4

A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (LŸsted @NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (LŸsted @NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."	3	2		3

However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe."	2	2		2

Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.

The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York."	3	3		3																					
16346	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea. Which the constructers later came to realize."	3	3		3

""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. LŸsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As LŸsted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As LŸsted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor."	3	3		3

One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared."	2	1		2																					
16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																					
16389	6	"Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock."	2	2		2																					
16393	6	"The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas."	3	4		4																					
16399	6	"In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal.

16407	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die."	3	3		3																					
16409	6	"The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable.

16422	6	"The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3

After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared""."	4	3		4																					
16454	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4		4																					
16461	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (LŸsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
16463	6	"It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction."	3	3		3

Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground.

The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16535	6	"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing."	3	2		2																					
16541	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome."	3	3		3																					
16546	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16550	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
16552	6	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building *************** "	1	2		2																					
16557	6	"The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
16558	6	"Many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building for that the engineers did not account. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot."	3	4		4																					
16572	6	"The empire State building had to face dangerous condition every day like @CAPS1 winds, heavy lifting, High heights."	1	1		1																					
16576	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are out lined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law, Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable."	4	3		4																					
16579	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so."	3	3		3																					
16580	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area."	2	2		2																					
16582	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out."	3	3		3																					
16584	6	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced."	3	3		3																					
16585	6	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock."	3	3		3																					
16593	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.	1	2		2																					
16596	6	"The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building. The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this out better."	3	3		3																					
16600	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."	1	1		1																					
16601	6	"The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest. This ment that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made."	1	2		2																					
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
16610	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
16616	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the first problems they faced was safety.

16630	6	"Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that, natural causes like high winds said in ¦ 6.

""over 46.2 million americans (15%) live in poverty."" i would like to counter this statement by saying we could always grow more food and give it to them. this brings bark my point from before. if we were to use satelites, we could track crops and soil. we could use this method to help find better soil and grow more crops for people in poverty. my last point is that it could help us find more planets. another quote from the paragraph says ""space exploration is important because it can motivate beneficial competition among nations."" these competitions gas helped us discover the moon. if we could explore space and find arother planet that we could live on, we could mover there just in case we can't live on earth. there is a possibility that this might happen because ononly ""6.3 billion dollars is spent on renewable energy."" there is a lot of pollution now and there will be even more pollution later on. it could become very dangerous and we would have two choices: 1) stay here and become extinct or 2) move to another plant and live. i think we should fund for space explovation. i hope that my essay has convinced you. in conclusion, i think we should spend money on space exploration."	22	20		3				5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

20940	7	"well i agree with both sides of the argument, but more of the money being spent help the world. i think that the space funding should just get less money instead of them getting no money at all. the united states government should be willing to help people from different places in the world. that's why i agree with both sides. in the first article ""a question to consider"" it says that 15% of americans live in poverty. sice the nasa funding is so high if you decrease the amount of money they get, that money could be used to help those 15% of americans. in life there are a bunch of people who have a family and struggle to make a living and support their own family and that is just sad. in africa, there is a disease called malaria and it is life threatning. people say, why don't they just buy nets to protect them. well if they could i'm sure they would but they can't afford it. that is why i am saying that the government should take money from the nasa funding and use the money to help other people in life. even though in the last paragraph i was talking about how they should take away some of the fundings and i still agree with that, but i think they should never consider cutting all of the fundings. if you cut the fundings astronaunts can't make new discoveries in the world. people as a kid dream about one day going to space, but if you want to help fund their dreams they will be very sad. right now as a kid, even though i don't know what career i want, being a astronaut is definetly one of my top 4 dream jobs. that is why i think the government should still fund nasa. as you might think why i agree with both sides of the articles i feel that it is very important to learn new things in life and help people to make the earth better. decreasing the fundings could help charity's or get better medicine, for people if you help a charity by giving them some money it would motivate other people to help also. in sports there are lots of players that already help charity's but do you think that is enough. even though i gave lot of reasons for decreasing the fund people still should not be cutting the funds. so now you know why i agree with both sides of the article. i hope that the government changes their mind, and starts funding nasa again. hopefully one day i will be able to help make a discovery in space for the world."	20	14	40	1				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

""indeed, over 46.2 million americans are in poverty."" but, maybe we can cut back on something else such as military expenses perhaps? space exploration is a win-win situation where we get something back that is priceless - knowledge. we have gone too far to quit. without satellites, we wouldn't have weather forecasting and knowledge of where to distribute crops. ""they can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, etc."" satellites has improved our lives and this was because of the advacement of technology. space travel is a safe investment and we should continue this. without it, we wouldn't know nearly as much about planets and the solar system. in conclusion, i think that space travel should be kept alive. it motivates young people to go out and explore. this is worth it and should not be cut. there will be other ways to solve problems. cutting space travel isn't an option."	18	15		3				3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3

21145	7	"is space exploration really desirable when there all of these problems on earth? many people think it is, many people think it isn't, we need to answer this question though because we are spending 19 billion dollars on space exploration. personally, i think it is worth it, let me tell you why. first of all, 19 billion dollars isn't that much when you put it in perspective. it's actually only 1.2% of the national budget. also, compared to all the other things we spend money on, it isn't that much. we spend 670 billion dollars on national defense, which is 26.3% of the national budget. we also spend 6.3 billion dollars on clean energy. some might think that 19 billion dollars is a crazy large amount of money, but it's not when you look at everything else. another reason space exploration is worth it is because it gives us tangible benefits. when nasa figured out how to study and prepare astronauts, it led to new medical instruments and information on the human body under stress. nasa scientists have also developed innovations like better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting. all of these resulted from technology used in space exploration. also, satellites in space can give us information that can help us produce and distribute food better. some people would rather use the money to help people directly. however, space exploration can kill two birds with one stone. people opposing say that we should use the 19 billion dollars to improve people's lives on earth. however, space exploration can improve life on earth. it gives us better machines, more information, and many more tangible benefits. space exploration is worth it because 19 billion dollars isn't that much when you put it in perspective space exploration gives us tangible benefits. some say we should use the money to improve life on earth but space exploration does improve life on earth what we need to do is explore space with earth in mind."	17	15		2				4	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

(p1) we should be taking out funds from space exploration or national defence to help some people in africa. some people may say but national defence and space exploration are just as important. it is true that they are important and will help us in the long haul, but we don't need to put 670 billion dollars into national defence. they can spare a little bit of money to help people in africa. i contend that the money distribution is unfair. on the flipside though space exploration is extremely important too. for example, space exploration has helped make better excersise machines, airplanes and better weather forcasting. some people may say, why do we use so much money for things that aren't really necessary. well, really its not rally that much money if you compare it to national defences. so i contort that space exploration is very important. as you can see, space exploration and world problems are both important. but money can be taken from other places to fund both of these issues. that's why i think these issues are both important."	24	23		3				5	4	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4

21310	7	"should we fund space exploration when there is so much to be done on earth? many believe that the time, money and energy used on building spaceships should be instead be used on fighting poverty and finding clean energy sources. other thought that pace exploration is worth our attention because with space exploration we can find out more about the world and new technologies could be developed. in my opinion, i think that we should continue to support space program. first of all, as i said, we get to find out more about the world. with space explorations we could find new things, maybe develop the technology of making those afford or find new minerals that can be useful for new technologies. we also stand a chance of finding a habitable planet. if we do, than the chances of overpopulation and starving could be lessened. people who disagree with this may point out that building spaceships and looking for habitable planets will take lots of time and technology while the millions of starving and dying people in africa are not getting enough help. why cant awe attend to the people in poverty over there first then go back to exploring space. well, i say if we never start looking well never find those planets. also, the entire u.s. national budget is not only spent on space programs. so the money don't have to be taken from space programs. besides, we cannot afford to wait until the satellites of ours fall our of the sky and neither can we lose the specially trained people because we cant fund them. the millions of people in poverty will take years and we simply cannot wait that long. as i said before, the money for charity font have to be taken from the space program since all the u.s. yearly national money is not all spent on the space programs. there are a shocking amount of money going to the military each year, and we aren't even being attacked anymore. while we need to have a standing army, we do not to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on each soldier each year. in addition, we have less chance of being attacked if a space race between countries is happening and everyone's attention is on that. if it happens, a competition on building spaceships and launching them will for everyone's advantage. there will be less wars and more technological advances are bound to happen. it has been done before between the u.s. and russia back in the 1960s. called the cold war. it resulted in improved exercise machines, more advanced aircraft, and more accurate weather forecasting. it will also be similar to the renaissance. though we are not rediscovering part. a space race will help is to be a creative and curious society. opposers may also say that human lives are stull more worthy of attention than space programs. though no matter what people say, those in poverty is still not getting enough attention. though i agree with that, i still do not believe that space programs are where we should take the money. also, space programs have nothing against helping poor people and it has a chance of improving the lives of billions of people that is not those in poverty with technological advances. in addition, space programs are already helping those in poverty. space programs launched satellites and those satellites can tell people where people need food the most without people wasting time looking in person. point being, while we should help people in poverty, we shouldnt take the money from the space program. that money should be spared from the unneccassarily huge budget going to the military. also, if we find habitable planets, we could possibly get more food, more space, and more resources and this can only be achieved through space programs. space exploration will also result in new technological advances, especially with space races. in addition, there will be less fighting if everyone's attention is on the space race. other than all that, satellites launched by space programs can save time and lives by telling people where poor people need food, and medical attention the most."	20	20		2				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

21319	7	"i agree that ""space exploration is desireable when there is so much that needs to be done on earth. my first of these reasons is that space exploration could lead to very valuable products being invented. it is true that people all around the world suffer from hunger and poverty everyday. but these kind of people could also benefit from space explorations well as most people in africa dying from malaria simply because theyre too poor to afford the nets that drive mosquitos away. it is possible, with the help of space exploration to help these people by developing a medicine that cures malaria. another reason is that like said in the article, ""19 billion dollars is not too much"", considering the amount the u.s spends for national defense (670 billion, 26.3% of the national budget). the fact that the government is putting more money into space exploration than projects to clean the earth's air must mean that space exploration is important to them in a way. my final reason is that space exploration could lead to an advance in technology and forecasting systems. by studying space and the experiences astronauts get in space, machines were made to learn about the conditions astronauts may get in space. for example, from the astronauts' experiences, doctors were able to learn more about stress in the human body. by studying space improvements in things like weather forecasting were made. by continuing at this rate, the scientists may be coming close to solving a huge problem that has affected the earth for a long period of time"	23	23		2				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	4

21352	8	"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."	17	20		37				3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21354	8	" i woke up at @NUM1 from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before. after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could. once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one i got wasn't what i expected. right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes. i got kinda mad at him because i didn't know what he was laughing at , until i looked down and realized i had no pants on, i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake. i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke, they didn't believe me at all, i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.    after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing iv done like that,i replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met .in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i."	17	18		35				4	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21361	8	"                                   @DATE2 I woke up on a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS5 one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was @CAPS5 one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS5 one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. @CAPS7 was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day.  @CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS7 couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS7, the less @CAPS7 made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS7 up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1've reached @ORGANIZATION1,"" a woman on the phone said. "" @CAPS2 @MONTH1 I help @CAPS1?"" ""@CAPS3, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""@CAPS4, are @CAPS1 still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was @CAPS7 something that I said?"" I asked. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS5, I'm so sorry,"" @CAPS8 said, trying to keep herself from laughing. "" @CAPS5, @CAPS7's just that, do @CAPS1 know what day is today?"" ""@CAPS7's @DATE3, isn't @CAPS7?"" @CAPS8 laughed again. ""@CAPS5, today isn't @DATE3, @CAPS7's @DATE2."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS7 was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21364	8	"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21369	8	" Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day"	15	14		29				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3						
21370	8	" My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue."	16	15		31				3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21379	8	"  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21382	8	" Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away."	22	20		42				5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21386	8	" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house."	21	19	42	42				4	5	5	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4	4	4

We headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about @TIME1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride.  When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about @NUM4 o'clock pm. So we just hung out until @NUM5 o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about @NUM4:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about @TIME1 we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME1 or @NUM7 of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM8 in the @TIME2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at @NUM9 in the @TIME2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little @CAPS2 then headed to bed for the night.  "	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up ""your walls."" Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: @CAPS1's those people who laugh when they cry, when @CAPS1 mad, when @CAPS1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think @CAPS1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let ""it all on the line."" @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter @CAPS2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @CAPS2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people."	15	10		25				3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2						
21413	8	" Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful."	25	21		46				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	4						
21427	8	" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. "	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21433	8	" A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was a warm @DATE1 @CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @CAPS3. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS2 all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS3. We all agreed that @CAPS4 was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS1. To start off, we all met @CAPS2 the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON3, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, @CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS6 @CAPS7 first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS4 was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS4. Unfortunately, @CAPS4 costed @MONEY1 that i did not have, so we left @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Next, we went to @NUM1 @CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON3 and I created a black teddy @PERSON1 with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS4 an awsome top hat and named @CAPS4 @CAPS11 @PERSON1. We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY2 for @CAPS4 and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS4 was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION1, left the @CAPS3, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS4 was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS4 up almost as tall as me before @CAPS4 toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS4 lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. @CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS4 didn't quite work. @PERSON4, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON4 had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS4 back to @PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed @PERSON3 as we all made @CAPS4 up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS4 was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS4. @PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and then @CAPS5. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS2 the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS4 was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS4 had turned out to be an even better @CAPS1 than we had expected. The whole @CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?"	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21438	8	" Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile."	23	23		46				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	6	5	5	4						
21440	8	" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	4						
21442	8	"                                        Laughter  @CAPS1 I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS3 odd it is, @CAPS3 much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS3 bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS3 weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS3 people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21443	8	" Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten."	17	25	34	34				4	4	4	4	3	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	3	3

21456	8	"            ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you @CAPS11 never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it @CAPS11 make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and @CAPS11 always put a smile on our face when we @CAPS2 down.It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will causes you to be come one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of @CAPS7 life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever.  @DATE1 was the day i met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by @CAPS7 amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to @CAPS1 some fun. We quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS7 soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS4 had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS7 eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS7 eyes, it wasn't @CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS7 high school. @CAPS3 leans down and ask me, ""@CAPS2 you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone,""yes..."" @CAPS3 smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS7 body. I look at him and @CAPS11 tell @CAPS3 was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS7 feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits @CAPS7 mouth is, ""@CAPS4 is your name?""@CAPS3 reply's with a smile and says, "" @CAPS6 and you?""""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS3 would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS3 reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS7 spine. @CAPS3 says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?""A huge smile washes over @CAPS7 face as i say ""yes."" @CAPS3 grabs @CAPS7 hand and walks me closer to @CAPS7 friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS7 house. @CAPS3 smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is. The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS7 head was, I cant believe @CAPS3 wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION1. When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. ""@CAPS11 i kiss you?"" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH1 @CAPS3 rest in peace...

21457	8	"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said ""@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told ""@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.

21458	8	"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21467	8	" It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21471	8	" Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21472	8	"I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS3"" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. @CAPS6 i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS7 wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS13 i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS6 your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS13 i didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS8 was so anxious to see what @CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS7 out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS7 the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS7. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS13 nervous @TIME1 the same time to see what @CAPS7 would be like. Finally the day was here, honey wake up time for @CAPS5 mom said already @CAPS13... oh forget @CAPS7 i said im groin to @CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed brush my teeth, hair, do my make up and get dressed. ""@CAPS9"" ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON2 is here time to go.

This is you first period @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in @CAPS8 staring @TIME1 me, my sstomach turning into notes wanting to fall out of my stomach. Welcome @LOCATION1 just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says. She shows me where to sit ans introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, @CAPS13 i still have to go to six more. This day feels like its going bye for ever, i walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary @CAPS13 no i was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce my self in the front of the class @CAPS7 was terrifying! I get on the bus can't wait to get @CAPS2. I walk threw the doors, how was your day, did you make friends, mom calm down i said to her sorry i just want to know. My day was @CAPS11, can i go take a shower now? Yeah just don't take long k.

21479	8	" Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21481	8	"Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left."" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""@CAPS3 think this is funny?"" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?"" ""@CAPS6"", @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21494	8	"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	3						
21502	8	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   "	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4						
21506	8	"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   "	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21509	8	"So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!"	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21514	8	" I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it."	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4						
21518	8	" Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh."	19	20	40	40				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21519	8	"Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS6 your names?"" and ""@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21522	8	" It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21526	8	" I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS6!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.

21532	8	" ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5

Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21542	8	" Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21545	8	"          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21553	8	" One rainy, @DATE1 day in a far away place their was a soccer game.that i was in. I remember that day like it was yesterday.It was the last game of the season,so it was important to me but some things went wrong in the process. I was going to the same like I said. I was just wearing my uniform my aunt said bye as I did. but out of the deep blue shy a big black rain cloud comes out. Oh @CAPS1. so I'm in on the beach thinking to my self the game going to get called off. On it my turn to go in. now in font ready for the for the ball,@CAPS2 I fall on my face. then i fall again coach take me out. so he did, i go back on the beach hopeful the team can do it with out me. game over we lose by two points, its time to leave now but where is my aunt? i called her on my coach's phone , @CAPS1 answer.

21570	8	"Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21581	8	" Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS1 that when a guy try's to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so called ""ice"" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT1, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON1 and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON1 I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" @CAPS3 meant a lot to me, for @PERSON1 is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS3 was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON1 feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship. "	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21586	8	" When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him."	18	21		39				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	4	5	5	4	4						
21599	8	" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories."	25	22		47				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4						
21606	8	"One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21613	8	" Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing.

When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!"	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21618	8	" A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21629	8	"When you laugh, is @CAPS5 out of habit, or is @CAPS1 cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS1 even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE1, @CAPS3 older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS3 sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS1 was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS3 body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS3 seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS5 shut once @CAPS3 body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS3 surprise, @CAPS5 was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS5 open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" @CAPS1 was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says...""@CAPS5 was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room locatated at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman-year-of-high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" @CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @CAPS1 sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered @CAPS5 and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, @CAPS1 was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" @CAPS8 in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of @CAPS3 mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends. "	20	26	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	6	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
