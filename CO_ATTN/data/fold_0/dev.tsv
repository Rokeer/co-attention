21	1	"the author did make a good convince that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because if you try these is a chocie that you could have a chocie at helping the people in kenya out of poverty. the millennium villages project was supposed to help accomplish to get people out of poverty and get them to health care and help them stabilize the economy. a better place for people to live and their timeline is set by 2015 and other's are by 2025. everyone in sauri doesn't have a bed net because some people are to deep in poverty to get it, the millennium village project target schools because if they want more supplies and that makes it better to learn and a better if they had a midday meal. i conclue that by 2015 they will be out of poverty. -"	4	4		1																					
22	1	"why we can win after reading this article made me rezalize that we can stop povertyfor example i found out kids are dieingevery day at least 20,000 kids because they are poor canÕt recive medicaine, education, and fertilzer for their survial. also most of them are shelter less did you know poor people can not go in resturants to eat or use the bathroom causing them to use the bathroom out side. one other reason why  i belive that poverty can be stop because are nation humanity can change any thing if you put you mind to it. why cant we the reason i say we cant because all the money goverments our  paying to fix things that are mess up because tsumnins hurricanes tornatos all of these disater are making it waste to stop poverty and some people are all ready broke and cant donate anmd some people are petty to donateto help out to make it better for people that need medicne education shelter fertilizer. but if this stuff change we could stop it togather for all hope of humanity."	2	1		1																					
25	1	"yes, the author did convince me that the Ò winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó the author made me convinced because, in paragraph 9, it says that the hospitals has improved by having medicine, and water connected to it. another reason why i was convinced was because also in paragraph 9, it says  the school now serves lunch for the students. one other reason why the author convinced me was because in paragraph 9 it says bed nets were used in every sleeping site in sauri. people in sauri called this a better life because it actually was better life. also all of this happened in 2008, so sauri had a poverty lifein 2004, but 4 years later it became better. i also think people in our lifetime can do the same thing because we are unique and talented.  this is why the author convinced me say yes."	4	4		1																					
26	1	"is winning the fight over proverty achievable in our lifetime? some people might say yes and some would say no, but people die from proverty everyday. i think proverty can be beaten in this lifetime even though 50% of the world live on less than $2.50 a day and 115 million out of the 2.26 billion kids in the world donÕt attend school. for the costs to buy stuff for the people in proverty well us people in the bay area can pay for it. also the stuff they need isnÕt really expensive. some people might not want to help, well then just how will they fee if they were the people in proverty and they donÕt get help? we also helped a village of 200-500 people in just four years, canÕt we help more people over this lifetime? some people might also say that helping just one village at a time wonÕt be fast enough. we donÕt have to just help one village at a time if we all chip in we can help out more places at once. some people might also say that we donÕt have to help. well for one thing thatÕs selfish. also if we want proverty to be gone we will have to atleast help alittle. if we can all chip in and donate to organizations that help end proverty than proverty will probobly be gone in about 50 years. another way can be to start up your own organization with some people and get donations to help people in need get food, medicine, farming equipment, and school supplies. so if we help in some way we can end proverty before tthe twenty second centry."	5	4		0																					
44	1	"the author did not convince me that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our time lime. he said ""the goals are supposed to be met by 2015"" but with all these problems it's impossible. there a bad problems like ""maliria, the crops are dead, disease's, and clean water is scarsie. they also get paid one dollar a day. i deleave they well achieve there goal in 2018. thats why i think the whole world should tip in and support these desasters. i also think it is wrong to sit back and do nothing while other people are in need. if we were in there shoes we would wont help to. these are some other things why the authore does not convince me. they are low on fertillizer, there clothes our tattered and they barley get midical support. this is why the author did not convince me."	4	4		1																					
45	1	"based on the article the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable.  while reading this essay you will learn about why i think you can win the fight against poverty. if they saved up money for fertilizer they could find their way out of poverty.  farmers can use fertilizer for their crops and then they wouldnÕt have to worry about food and they could sell their crops.  this is one reason i think people can win the fight against poverty. another way people can fight their way against poverty is that they can make a meadicine for malaria that is affordable.  20,000 kids die every day from mosquitos each day from mosquitos.  if they made an affordable meadicine for malaria many people would by it.  this is another reason i think they can fight their way against poverty."	4	4		0																					
56	1	"my opinion on the millenium village projects before the millennium village project started, kenya was another country blown away by poverty, children in tattered clothing running around barefoot, women on the ground selling bananas, i donÕt believe these are healthy things to do. malaria was a big problem. to many children suffered and died from it and many adults got sick. it was tragic to hear about so many people suffering. another problem is that the hospitals were overcrowded, there were 3 children to a bed and 2 adults to a bed, some people canÕt even get help. there was no running water or electricity so it was dark, and noone could wash. after the millennium villages project was started, they set targets and goals for poverty to be gone, for good. they started making bed nets with chemicals that last 5 years so that almost nobody will get malaria, plus bed nets are five dollars so it is almost affordable to anyone. school has no fees so children could go to school, they have books, pencils, and the supplies they need. they also have midday lunch so the students could eat. the attendance rate is up really high. there have been a lot of changes which makes life better for a lot of villages. there is even electricity and running water in the hospitals now. it just makes it all the more easier to win the fight against poverty."	5	5		2																					
64	1	"in my opinion, i think the author has convinced me into the idea of Òwinning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our life timeÓ. in this world there are so many places that has porverty that you can fix. itÕs just one or two minor things that caused it. in the passage, the reason that sauri was in porverty is because there was a malaria disease. and farming, water and school fees. another thing that makes me convinced is that, this crisis is fixed in 4 years, which is in 2008, the text also saidsÓ the people in sauri have made amazing progress in just four years.Ó something else that also makes me convinced is that the people lived on $1 a day in 2004, and now every single sleeping site has a bed net which costed $5, so this is an idea that shows that sauri did improve and beat poverty. another fact for this passage is that in 2004, many students had to pay for the school he/she went to, and many of them didnÕt have a medday meal which might of caused concentrating in classes hard. then in 2008, there were no school fees, they served lunches, and the attendence rate gone way up. the health at sauri also gone better, now there is medicine, no charge. and a cure for common dieases. the change of sauri not of convinced me that i could beat poverty, also that i should not waste money on things i donÕt actually need."	4	3		2																					
78	1	"no i do not think making poverty history is possible because poverty is hard to take. in the article they started in 2004 with everything being bad. 2008 everything was better. it took 4 years to help part of kenya better. sauriÕs progess was good but thatÕs only a little bit of africa which is mostly poor. africa is one country thatÕs a little poor, but there are alot of other countries that have poverty and need help. it might take 4 years to make a little part of that country one by one. even if the world works together we can help some places with poverty but you never know something might happen and they have to do it all over again. some places need food which is hard because the people have to grow it again. some places have diseises which takes time to cure and the hostpital canÕt always help them so they have to wait. poverty can be fought but is hard to take down."	5	5		0																					
80	1	"126501y3_ 000533713 i think we can perish poverty. in the article is said that sauri made huge improvements in just 4 years. every sleeping site had a bed net and medicene was free of charge. it went from dying people who couldnÕt afford simple medicene to medicene is now free of charge. people now had seats, water, and fertizler to plant food. the schools have alot of supplies and no fee. i think if we can acheive these things in only 4 years i can only imainge what will happen in 2015, or even better in 2025. thats why i think the millennium villages projectÕs goal is achevible in this lifetime."	4	4		2																					
87	1	"126501y2_ 000517349 the author did convince me that winning the fight agaisnt poverty is acheivable in our luife time. the text says that in four years the hospital got medicine, water, and a generator for electricity. also bed nets are now used in sauri to keep away mosquitoes. farmers now have fertilizer, water, and tools to grow crops. in 2004 there were school fees and school didnÕt surve lunch, by 2008 the fees were gone and they surved lunch. all this happened in four years much more can happen in about 7 years."	5	5		2																					
97	1	"what is the millennium villages? the millennium villages is a project that the united nations started. it helps people in kenya have a better life. i believe that the millennium villages has helped many people in the villages of kenya. before the millennium villages started people were living in poverty. hannah sachsÕ article states, Òthere were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. the room were packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. there was no doctor, only a clinical officer running the hospital. there was no running water or electricityÓ. (1) even though there are simple solutions for those who seek medical treatment, they cannot afford things such as be nets, which only cost $5. each household lived on less than $1 a day. people who live in sauri need money so they can afford simple things to help keep them healthy. the farmers in sauri had a hard time tending to crops. hannah sach claims that,Ó their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigationÓ. (2) year after year, farmers plant their crops hoping that the plant will flourish and grow, but the lack of water and fertilizer makes it hard for anything to grow. when the crops donÕt produce enough, then farmers wonÕt have much to harvest and the family will go hungry. most children of sauri did not go to school. why? the couldnÕt afford it. in sauri, kids had to work around the house or on the farm. even the schools couldnÕt afford many supplies such as paper and pencils. so what is the solution to this problem in sauri? the millennium villages has helped provide medicine for hospitals, which was free for people. the hospital now has water and electricity. families have bed nets to keep mosquitoes from people who are asleep. the millennium villages project has helped farmers get fertilizer and water for their crops. the project has also helped schools to get supplies such as books, paper and pencils. this shows how much the project has helped. from the year 2004-2008, dramatic changes occurred. the millennium villages has helped out a lot."	4	4		3																					
101	1	"yes the author did tell us that fighting against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because under a better life it said winning fights against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.  in under the fight for better health said three kids to a bed and two adults. ex1.  if we did not have fertilizer we wouldnÕt have vegables. ex2.  first, the hospitl had fees now it donÕt have fees ex3.  if we did not have bed net maskitetos would bite us."	5	5		0																					
110	1	"the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó one reason that the author convinced is that she actually went there with her time, to go and see what was happening. another reason of how she convinced was the part about the water, fertilizer, and knowledge. it reminded me that some kids in africa barely even have water. they also probably get less food then i do too. the part about the schools was saddening, but it wasnÕt for pity. all kids deserve a good education, and health. then thereÕs also their goal about not having poverty in 2015. that convinced me because people in the world are also trying their best to stop poverty. from this article i do believe that we can stop poverty by 2015."	3	3		1																					
124	1	"the author did convince me that it is achievable in this lifetime to fight against proverty. she has convinced me by first fixing the hospital so they can have nets so the mosquitoes wonÕt kill them. they have already treated people to cimple diseases, cause they know the first thing they need to do is get people heathly so they can live. another thing that convinced me was the fact that they fixed the schools for thouse children who want to learn and get an education to better there lives in the future. i know some of them couldÕnt affprd supplies but i didÕbnt think it was fair that they were not getting the education they needed, so iÕm glad  there fgetting it now. i was also convinced by them getting donations by people over here. now not only can they be healthy and have a good education they can have good clothes, shoes, and supplies."	4	3		2																					
130	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? some people believe that it can not be won in our lifetime. others believe that we can fix poverty in the next 50 years. this is important because the 50% of the world in poverty will be helped and have a better life. i believe that if every one dips in, we can use the 7 billion chances in the world to help. first of all, there are many organizations trying to help. the millenium project is a un leaded project to get people out of poverty and give them the necessities of survival. glide church is a san francisco based orginization that provides shelter, food, school, women programs, and much more, while raising money for poverty. some people may say that some orginizations are only based in one city. that is true, but they send money and supplies around the world also, many religious communities are trying to help. jews do tzadakah, which mostly goes to the middle east, but still helps. muslims do zakat. christians donate. some people may say that most of the money goes to the communisty that you payed. that is true, but only some. most of it goes to poverty. furthermore, schools are trying to help. they can work with orginizations like unicef to raise money. they also raise money by themselves. some people think that when schools rais money, itÕs for the school. that is mostly true, but my school (not ms) has raised money for poverty, and still does, i believe. some people say that we deffinately canÕt beat poverty in 50 years. i dissagree with this because many people are trying to help. those people out number those in poverty, so therefore, we can win. i believe we can win against poverty if everyone helps out. orginizations are helping, religious communities are helping, and even schools are helping. we can improve this situation by raising more money for medicine, supplies, shelter, and irrigation for people in need."	5	5		0																					
131	1	"all i know is that she convinced me. can you belive that an 12 year old went to kenya millennium villages to see what it was like in africa. its amisaing  how she collected all of this information. and how she convinced people that read her artical. she convinced me that this was a true story by how it sounded like she was right in front of the class speaking where she visit and what was it like in kenya, africa. for an example; on that day in 2004 we followed the village leaders in to yala sub-district  hospital. if was not in good shape. another exampe; we walked over to see the farmers. there crops where dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. also another example; when i went to the villages iÕve seen kids with torn or ragged clothes on."	5	5		0																					
139	1	"it is important for us to know that people in kenya are having hard problems because she might think we can help them. we can also buy the stuff the need too. she might think that because we have the money and we can give it to them. kenya is slowly dying and we can help. before (in 2004) they had no money at all. they diddnÕt food because they couldnÕt afford it. they diddnÕt have water in their hospitals, nore eletricity. they couldÕt even go to school because they couldnÕt afford. well now (in 2008) the have money. they can go to school now because they have money. they can eat because they have money. they can do what we can do because they have money and the stuff they need. in my conclusion thats why the author might have wrote about. kenya need help and we can give the help."	3	4		1																					
142	1	"kenya is a town in sauri and when they author of this article visited that place it was poor, sickened, dirty, diseased, no doctors, and no medicine. now in kenya their is more money, unsickened 70%, medicine to cure, hospitals, doctors, and protectant from diseases."	5	5		1																					
144	1	"for my essay i will be writing about the millennium villages project and how it will help to change poverty. i think itÕs a great program, and i think if a lot of people get involved, iÕm pretty sure it could make a difference. this project has helped kenya, sauri in many ways. like the water and electricity. in the hospital they got a lot of help including running water, which they didÕnt have before. the water will help alot with the pacients. also it has helped with the electricity. they now have a generator, which i think every builiding needs. the project has not only helped the hospital and itÕs pacients, but it has also helped the kids and their education. they made the schools have no school fees, which helps a lot because a lot of the families didÕnt have money and now the kids can get their education. it has also helped with the school supplies. the schools also now give lunches to the kids so they could focus on their work. it has also helped the farmers and a lot of families buy giving them seeds and tools to grow food. before the project came all they had were crops. now they have fresh food growing for themselves and for their families. before the program there were a lot of kids who were hungary. i thin in total, seeing what this program has done for kenya, it will make a change. even mabey if itÕs not able to help the entire world, at least it can make changes in a lot of places. taking away poverty for good would be such a great thing for the world. it would probably change many things, like mabey the price of everything. mabey the prices changing would be a good thing or a bad thing. iÕm pretty sure it would be a good thing for everyone."	4	5		2																					
145	1	i think it is not possible because it it was is a lot of job to do and it is really hard to chagne a whole city in just 21 years. they had no money and they have bad climate. they also had a lot of problem. they had no money and it really hard to plant in place like that. they had a really bad deise that kill lot of people but they didnÕt even have 5 dollar to buy a net to save all that lives. they have not money to pay the school fee. if the children dosenÕt have school. it will countinue for generations.	5	5		1																					
146	1	the author did conveince me about winning the fight against poverty because it is one of the things that i alweys do but also in 2008 the people of sauri have a lot of things to save people. for example in says in paragraph 9 hospitals have medicine free of charge. what i think of that is that they treat the people that really need the medicine really bed. for an example it says paragraph 8 a lot of kids could not afford to go to school because their parents could not pay for it. it says that kids had to work to get money. for example the kids could go to school and they had learned a lot they wanted to learn because it was their choose. for example the kids did not have energy after school in paragraph 8.	3	3		1																					
150	1	"after reading Òa brighter futureÓ by hannah sachs i am convinced that most of the worldÕs poverty problems could be solved. however, i do not agree with the statement, Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó i donÕt agree with this statement because it took the millenium villages project 4 years just improve one village. think about how long it would take to just defeat poverty in africa. i do think that itÕs possible to Òwin the fight against povertyÓ with the help of the millenium villages project, just not in our lifetime. one thing that the people of sauri needed help with was their crops. in this report, hannah sach states that farmers didnÕt have the money for fertilizer and irrigation systems. without these things, the farmers would never know how many edible crops would be produced from each harvest. therefore, they would be left worrying and wondering if they would have enough money to feed their families. unfortunately, the disease malaria wasnÕt uncommon in this village. without misquito nets, many children would die from this disease. since the people of sauri didnÕt have enough money to keep nice hospitals, there was almost no hope for the people who caught the disease. people in sauri were also not very well educated. they had schools, but most families either didnÕt have enough money, or needed their children to help out at home. they were also very lacking in school supplies. the children tried to learn with the materials that they had, but it made it very hard to learn. although these problems were solved by the mellenium villages project, thats just one of the many villages in poverty all over the world. even though sauri is a much better place, thereÕs still china, and the rest of africa. i think that they did a great job with sauri, now they just have to help the rest of the world out of poverty, which i think is possible."	4	4		1																					
151	1	"yes i do think its posible. i think it posible because they made so much progress in 4 years! they got water for the hopital. they had energy. the kids got free lunches so they wont lose energy and wont strarve of the end of the day. they got medicine for diseases that are commen, that means that they wont get sick or pass away. every sleeping area have bed net for when people are sleeping the wont get but by moskidos and they wont get sick. now they have fertilizer and seeds. and they have tools to maintain food suply. this proves that it is posible to change ways in our life time. for kids dieing to kids playing. from deseases to happyness. this is why i think it possible."	4	4		1																					
153	1	"yes, because if we have the supplies we need we can fight proverty. for example, if we have the right medicine we can cure all of diseases. also, if we have some good fertilizer we can grow better crops to feed lot of hungry people. they also had education and free lunch now so the student will have energy."	5	4		2																					
156	1	"the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because in the section water, fertilizer, knowledge said ""in 2004, the schools had minimal supplies like books, paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn. in section the fight for better health it says ""the yala sub-district hospital it was out of shape and there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. in that section the fight for better health said ""the rooms were packed with patients who probably would not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or patients could not afford it. in section water, fertilizer, knowledge ""there crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. my opinion is that we should donate money to kanya so they could perchase or get what they need. we should ship them some more beds to go in the hospital rooms and some more bed nets to go over the beds."	4	4		1																					
167	1	"i think the answer is yes, we can win the fight against pocerty. with the right recorces an enogh people we can. for example, in the article they did one village in four years. if they had had another group it would be 2 villages in four years. that would be easier than one group to a village. another way i know we can win the fight against poverty is because if they give the farmers fertilizer and seeds they can make monye and they can take care of their own families. the last reason is if the hospital gets some real doctoras the pationtes will get batter and they will go work and get out of poverty. theas examples prove that we can win the fight aganist poverty."	4	4		0																					
171	1	"the author wanted us to learn about how it was fun and happy but now the place is bad. and not enough good health and people have to suffer for no health. these are my three examples of kenya before. they were having fun dancing and clapping, kid running and playing with their friends and they were joyful. these are my three examples of kenya after. there crops were dying because no fertilizer and irrigation, needed better health and not enough supplies."	4	4		0																					
172	1	"i do believe the fight against poverty can be won because it happened in sauri, kenya. in just 4 years the area's state improved. the condition of the hospital improved. there was no doctor, no electricity, and no water. now there is medicine to cure patients, service is free of charge, there is water and electricity. also the disease malaria was being spread while people were sleeping. there are now bed nets to protect the people. the millennium villages project didn't stop at sauri. they have also helped other villages. they have helped many sub-sahara villages (80 of them). they have helped many places in one project. this another example of the possibilities of ending poverty. people, like the ones in the millennium villages project, have shown us that we can end poverty. the job may take a long time but it can be done. the millennium villages project has also shown that all you have to do is show you care. these are all examples of why i think poverty can be ended."	4	4		3																					
175	1	"the author convinced me because in 4 years sauri made a great improvement in poverty. in 2004 sauri you had to pay to go to school and there was no midday meals. there was no electricity, medicine, nor doctors. farmers didn't have fertilizer nor water to grow good crops to feed their families. in 2008 school was free and they gave you lunch. there was electricity, medicine, and doctors. i enfer that the way that this is going poverty might be gone in 2015."	4	4		2																					
177	1	"the author wanted to tell you about kenya in 2004 and tell you now. when kenya was in 2004, they had no food, lunch meals at school and peaple died from a disease named marlaria. now they had fertilizer to make food, lunch at schools and bed with chemical for marlaria."	4	4		1																					
183	1	"yes, because in the text it says that it's possible that poverty can be beaten. for example it said that the people of sauri have made amazing progress. also that there are many solutions to the problems . and that encouraging supporters will really help."	4	4		1																					
184	1	"yes the author did convince me into thinking that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. i say this because if in only 4 years a place like sauri, kenya can turn into a place were its ok to live. in paragraph 4 it talks about how hannah could help with the health issues. when she first walked in she saw how there were sick children and adults everywhere. it was so horrible that she felt sad. but when 4 years passed the hospital had electricity and was free of charge. in paragraph 7 it talked about how the farm crops looked. they looked very horrible because there wasnÕt any water or fertalizer. it was so bad that farmers were afraid their children werenÕt going to have enough food to survive. but in 4 years farmers had lots of fertilizer and water. in paragraph 8 it talked about how school life was. that was also very bad. children didnÕt have books, pencils, or papers. some of the parents couldnÕt even afford for school. but in those 4 years the schools were provided with books, papers, and pencils. the schools had lunches and no fees. that is why i say Òyes!Ó winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	4	4		3																					
197	1	"i think the goal of fighting poverty can be achieved because with a lot of people helping it can be acomplished. i also think the goal can be made because in just 4 years the yala sub district hospital has medicine, water and eletricity. also bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertillizer, seeds and tools. there are no school fees and schools now serve lunch. the goals are supposed to be met by 2015, other are supposed to be met by 2025. the progress is engouriging supporters of the project. with work and help we can fight poverty."	5	5		2																					
200	1	"the author did convince me because how the things changed like they had no midday meal and few supplies like books, papers and pencils. family could not afford school fees. plants were dying because farmers could not afford fertilizers. some hospital could not even afford medicine they had no running water or electricitiy. they had 3 kides on a bed and 2 adults in one bed. just in 4 years everything change like the hospitals has medicine for all common diseases and water is connected to hospitals and the electricity works there are enough beds for people in hospitals. there is enough supplies for kides in school. they serve kids lunch now. now farmers could afford fertilizers for plants also seeds and at school they are school fees."	4	4		2																					
207	1	"yes, i think that the author did convince me that Ôwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life-timeÓ. he/she told that the program started in 2004 and when it started sauri, kenya looked awfull had so much problems and hospitols didnÕt have what they needed. but they the program would have ended in 2015 but only 4 years into the program (2008) in sauri, kenya is doing way better. like the hospitals have medicine, schools have food, the hospitals have electricity and the crops from the farm now have fertilizers for good food supply in farms. i think its great that they started this program because it helped villages in sauri, kenya and many people and they say that he program is supposed to end in 2015 but this is only 2008 it 2012 know i wonder how sauri, kenya look like now today are they doing much better than they were in 2008."	4	4		2																					
210	1	they went to kenya for a project then they went to the hospital to check people and they were laying down the bed. the millennium valliege to create and millinnium development of about the valliege. i agree that poverty can be eliminate the lifetime. people are hungry and needed some food to eat. then school farm kenya needed food and milk people from kenya need medicine from the hospital and they also needed food to peet people in the hospital they could gave people free water in the hospital. kenya problem is that they don't have that much food and money to buy their suppy for children that need to go to school. they parent have to work real hard to let the children education. i believe that they can work hard to peed their family in kenya. family need food to peed their children to eat. the hospital need food and water to gave people their. the farmer worry about their plant of vegetable. that havest enough food to feed the whole family they will work hard. to slove this promple people need to gave food to help people in different country so they could eat like us eat better ut if you think about them they are hungry. they need water so they could drink school need more milk so children are healthy	4	5		0																					
211	1	"yes the author provided one specific example of how the quality of life can be improved. i think these was the specific example the united nations call the millennium villages project in kenya, a country in africa. the united nations is an organization that helps in africa. the united nations is an organization that helps people around the world to have a safer, healthier and better life. the person who wrote this article was 12 years old when she visited kenya with her father in 2004 when the project was just beginning. at that time the people of sauri lived on less than $1 dollar a day. she also tell us in the article about her return to kenya and how the millennium villages project has help many people have a better life already but when i was in africa my parents had to pay school fees. and the was no lunch or breakfast in school for kids to eat &:00 to 2:00 we don eat and we did not have energy"	3	3		1																					
220	1	i think there will be people whoÕs winning the fight against poverty. think abuot your self you get one dollar each day. and you donÕt go to school. if you are your preants donÕt have enough money to get you to the hosipital when you are sick.	5	5		0																					
223	1	"i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in because people in the world can help each other. people can pitch in to do the things they can do best. another reason i think poverty is achieveable is because in the world things cost alot more now than before. it is harder to earn money. it is like africa not able to buy bed nets because poverty. people who lived in sauri, kneya couldn't be treated because there were no doctors. the children couldn't eat. children didn't eat lunch. their parents had to pay school fees. we could help them by donating helpful resources like food and water. we could also help donate bed nets to them so we could save about a few million lives. poverty is a bad thing. we could help them in many different ways though."	4	4		1																					
230	1	"well yea beacuse if we dont help them it can be very hard to live. well we could improve by people helping seand cand foods or colthes. well the aouther did convise me because they do need help well one example is that the people in sauri mad amazing progress in the yala sub-district hospital it has medicine, free of charge. like water is connetd to the hospital. another example is that the the farmers couldnet afford the necessary fertilizer. they were worried they wouldnet have food to feed the hole and there hrd work strye and become sick so well could help them by seand them can foods."	5	4		1																					
236	1	"i think that winning the fight agianst poverty is posiable in my life time. the only way that we can win the fight is by inproving the living condisions of the people that live in the poor places. we also need to help out in these places as much as posiable. we need to give them clothing, houseing, clean water, electricity, and a better hositals or health clinic. we need to give them medicine to help the sick people. we can give them better living condisions by making the floors not by dirt but sement. a home that has a roof, windows, doors, light, and clean working water. they would also need wormth, blankets, moskito nets, and cratens. they should also have better pluming. we can help poor places by letting people know and donate. we can give them better hospitals or health clinicÕs by having new and clean supplies. they need scales, files, and vacsense. they need a new building not a run down one. the floors need to not be dirt. they also need people that know how to use them. we can give them a better education by having teacher, class room, students, and a building that is proper. they need books that teach them, teachers that incerage them to have a better future. also have all the elementary, high school, middle school, and collage provided. they need good learning envioment. we need to have more jobs for the people. jobs that can help them. they need to help to find or make jobs in that area."	3	3		0																					
241	1	"121601 y2_000474088 i think that the phrase the author said Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievableÓ depends on how bad the poverty is because some people may be in deep poverty or countries. in this case, i think the author was right. for example the fertilization, farmers couldnÕt grow food as fast and as well as they couldÕve with fertilizer. no food means nothing to eat. the students had no midday meal which gave them no energy. so the help of the millennium villages project helped with that problem. help is one of the things that makes winning against poverty achievable, not saying that when youÕre in a crisis like this you depend on help all the time, sometimes you just need a little push to start on the right track and you can keep going from there. thatÕs what the millennium villages project. now kenya is doing great. in the passage it said that before no alot of students were going to school because of chores at home and low supplies but now with the help of the millennium villages project they got the supplies and more students getting educated."	4	5		1																					
244	1	"the author convinced me that the fight against poverty can be acheived. it can be acheived if you work hard enough, and if you work together. ever since the medicine for common diseases is free of charge, it saved most people. the school fees are free as well, so kids can learn. hospitals are connected to water, and an electricity generator. people arenÕt hungary anymore from seeds and fertilizer, as well as tools. i hope no one ever experinces that again."	4	3		1																					
253	1	"the winter convinced me that winning the fight of property is achievable because in four years, they turn a city with almost no medicine and doctor into a city with free medicines for common diseases. they turned a almost no bed net city into a city will all the people using it. and no, more student goes to school with midday meals, so that's why i'm convinced."	3	3		1																					
254	1	"i think this is achievable, because their goal is 2015 and the people in sauri already made progress in 2008.  thatÕs four years after the project started, and in another four years their project will be even better. another reason why i think this is achievable is because one of the main causes of death, in countires in africa such as kenya is malaria, and with the bed nets the death rate from malaria decreases and in 2008 every sleeping site is sauri had bed nets by 2015 they will have more people living there, because of less malaria infections.  and if there is more people living in sauri then there are more people working there. there is also school that have no school fees so more children can go to school and have better education for when they grow up. another health related reason that i think will make millenium villages project succed is that there is medicine that is free of charge.  water is connected to the hospital which gives them water to drink and water to shower in.  and the hospital also has a generator for electicity which gives the m light and warmth. the most important thing that they have is a stable food supply with fertelizer and seeds."	5	5		1																					
264	1	"poverty the author convinced me that poverty can be achieved. in one of the paragraphs they told about the goals they have already achieved. they have clothing, medecin and ect. they have been determined to achieve their goal. by the year they estimated they will achieve their goal. under teh subheading better life - 2008 they tell about the life in 2008 they tell about the life in 2008. they tell the goals already achieved. they have gotten medicine for the hosptial. so not many people will die. they now have bed nets that are free. they also have water. the water is in the hospitol. poeple can now bathe and drink. the water is clean. they now have a great life and are still working to achieve all their goals."	4	4		1																					
267	1	"the author convinced me that beating poverty in my lifetime is possible. for example, bed nets save lives. they only cost $5 each! the bed nets are cheap enough that a well-funded organization could save many lives each day! in my lifetime, malaria (the disease mosquitoes carry that can be prevented by bed nets) could be completely gone! without this disease hindering villages, people might be one more step closer to winning the war against poverty. another example is how quickly sauri advanced. more people attend school, and the school serves lunch now. many medicines are being used to fight common diseases. sauri made these improvements from a dirty, unlighted hospital with no doctor or water in just four years. my third example is hte goal of the millennium project. they thought they could raise the standard of living dramatically in just 11 years. i think this estimate of the time it would take was quite accurate, because the people working for the millennium project probably have had experience helping people and know how long it will take. so, i believe poverty can be overcome in my lifetime."	5	5		1																					
270	1	"the author is convinceing because she talks about all the main fact she just getÕs right to the point like when she sad thet they are taring to lat por people stay and a slater and how they need a new hopital because the sick people had to sale one bed and if it wasent a nuffe room one of them had to sleep on the floor and when she said 2,000 kids diea over one deyae i think this is a good story i wish i can meet the author of this stroy."	4	4		1																					
279	1	"in the article Òa brighter futureÓ the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because he was very orginizaed about the steps he would take to help end poverty. the text sates Òthe goals are supposed to be met by 2015.Ó this shows the the author has goals that need to be met by a sertant year that keeps him organized. the text also provides information about what the organization needs to provide to sauri, kenya to help it end poverty. the text states Òthe schools had minmal supplies like books, paper and pencils and most children canÕt afford to pay for school.Ó i think the author gives us a clue of what are the basic supplies they need to poverty. the text states Òa bed net treats the disease of malaria and most famlies canÕt afford it.Ó i think that the author gives use good edvidence on what children in sauri, kenya need to survive and the u.s. has the ability to help and end poverty."	5	5		2

319	1	"yes, the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because before, sauri schools, their supplies were low, and they gave the children no midday meal. after all of their amazing progress, the schools had enough supplies, all the kids had their midday meal and had enough energy for the day. also the attendance rate was way up!!! another example, is (before) hospitals were not in good shape. there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. the patients could not afford to recieve to treatment or the hospital did not have the treatment for the disease. there was also no running water or electricity. after the amazing progress, hospitals which also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri!! one other example is that crops were dying because the farmers could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. each year the farmers worry if they will harvest enough food to feed the whole family. their kids may go hungry and become sick. but after the amazing progress, the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. that is why the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in out lifetimeÓ!!"	4	5		3																					
321	1	"i belive that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime."" this is because the author has already achevied so much for example when she first started to take action ""crops were ding because people couldn;t afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation."" also the hospitals didn't have the nessesites to help everyone in need and din't have electricity or a connected water source. just four years after the author started the project, the hospitals had medicine that was free, with water and electricity. bed nets were provided ""to every sleeping site"" in order to prevent malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes. ""these mosquitoes come at night"" so it is hard to protect yourself. schools had higher attendance rates and he children were now feed during the say. ""hunger was addresed by being able to get the necessary ""fertilizer and seeds as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply."" although the task was very big the millenium village project made an impossible thing posible. the impoverished will soon regain there strenghth and be on their feet again. i do know that there is still more to do but one small thing can make a difference. for these reasons i belive that sauri, kenya's progress shows us that we can acomplish great things. also that ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime."""	6	6		2

394	1	"fighting poverty is a very difficult task not only in sauri, but in other places as well. in order to end poverty, you must get money from other countries, and i donÕt think most people know about the poor places in the world. the article listed a few examples about sauriÕs economy, but also said that within a few years they were able to improve their economy. they set their goal for around 10 year, and i donÕt think itÕs enough time to end poverty. according from the article, Ò20,000 kids die from this disease each day.Ó it states that around 20,000 kids die from maleria every day. thatÕs a lot of people! not only kids die, but adults also go through this crisis. one way to treat this horrible disease would be to use bed nets. bet nets are able to save million of live, yet they are too costly and people are unable to afford them. the solution to fighting maleria is simple to us, but possibly impossible for the people in sauri. another crisis that the people in sauri have to face would be their school fees. i believe that children should be able to walk into a school and use as much utencils as they want and to learn as much as possible to get ready for the future. sadly, the children in sauri are unable to do this due to the limited supplies and the expensive school fees. the students want to learn but they are unable to do that since itÕs hard for them to concentrate because they didnÕt get any midday meal, therefore they wouldnÕt have enough energy for class. it is really hard living in sauri. on top of having numerous deaths each day and a bed education, it is just a very unpleasant place to live in. women sit on the dusty ground and sell bananas. little kids would wear tattered clothes and walk around barefoot, having bananas on dusty grounds may spread bacteria and tattered clothes would cause the children to catch a cold. for these are the reasons why i believe ending poverty is a difficult task, and it may take more than 10 years. it is not an impossible task, since there were many improvements overtime. if people are determined to help out sauri, poverty would end it no time. but for now, there is still a lot to do, and many other places that needs help to end poverty."	4	3		2

441	1	"the author of this passage has convinced me that poverty could be ended. he/she has convinced me by showing how much they improved in 4Ðyears, imagin how they can improve by the time 2015 is here with our help. if we could improve their hospitals the death toll for children could lower drasticly. with the help with the lastest treatments this could be achievable. if we can we can make poverty become history, by tapping into everybodyÕs special abitities to help in someway. and the prescences of malaria infested mousqiuto can be iradicated if we can donate bug repelers or those lights that zap bugs, and if we donate unused school books they could get the education that everybody deserves. with the help of shoe stores we can give the people of africa unused models that people may destpertly need. with the help of consturtion workers that arnÕt busy they can help build buildings that poor people need in times of heat waves or sheer coldness. that is how we should help poverty end."	4	4		1																					
443	1	"yes, she did. hannah visited sauri in 2004, but by 2008, Òthe people sauri have made amazing process in just four years.Ó also the article stated that Òdramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.Ó and last of all, the thing that convince me most is when hannah said ÒsauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó so i am convince it is achievable to beat poverty in our lifetime."	4	4		1																					
447	1	"poverty has been an issue for years, centuries, and lifetimes. poverty is everywhere not only africa. so what makes you think it will end now? where would it end? i donÕt believe poverty will ever end because theres too much of it. there are tens and thousand of cities, neighborhoods, states, and countrys in poverty, and nobody has tried to stop and help, so the poverty rates just continue to rise. if we want to stop povorty money has to become worthless, however that wont happen anytime soon. so i dont believe poverty will stop in my lifetime unless theres a miricale and all these thousand, million, billion, and trillionaires give up all there money to these places in poverty, but i donÕt even believe that much money can help fix the poverty everywhere. there is too much greed and where theres greed theres poverty, greed creates unequality because somebody, anywhere, always wants more. so again do i think poverty will end in my lifetime? do i think it will every transform into something different? no, im sorry it to say, but i dont think poverty will ever be apart of history in my lifetime."	6	5		0																					
453	1	the author does not convince me because dosn't tell me ways that we can win the war against poverty. but i do belive that if the word hard that they could get energy in their schools and find the medicines they need to care their sicknesses.	4	5		0																					
454	1	"the author did not convince me of Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. itÕs gonna take a long time, people need to volunteer and money isne an example is, Òthe people of sauri have made amazing progress in just 4 years.Ó itÕs almost 4 years to almost remove poverty from a town. it could take a lot more for a city and country. another example is, Òthere were no doctors, only a clinical officer running the hospital.Ó people volunteering would not be mostly doctors and finding a doctor willing to go somewhere that has full of dieases wouldnÕt be so easy. the last example is, Òvillagers get technical advice and practical items, such as fertillzers, medicine and school suppliesÉa bed net, treated chemical that last for five yearsÉeach net costs $5.Ó money or donation would be a problem as there is poverty everywhere, not just a village or africa. more than billions of dollar would be spent and people donÕt really donate much unless they are a donoting as a commumy or fund-raising. honestly, ending poverty can happen but not in our/my life time es the time, people willing to volunteer and the money just kicks the time and extends it more. possible but just not in our lifetime"	4	4		2																					
459	1	"i was convinced that we can win this war on poverty. some of the issue are so little you'd it's ridiculus. everyone could donate five dollars for bed nets, and that's one bed bet less place down. it's that simple for some parts. we could also get some fertilizer, and garden tool manufacturers to donate some supplies. that's another way to help. there's a huge problem with education. we have stores that sell books and supplies. there's borders and staples. they could donate to places with schools. there's alot of ways that we can help people in poverty. were one of the richest countries in the world. we just have to put some effort in it. we could get people places to stay here in america. places that provide food, medical care, and of course a school. if possible we could make it like a really, really, really cheap hotel. there are some ways to help people in poverty. in 2004 all their problems looked so easy for us to fix. they can be if we think of how to fix them there are people dying of small dieseses everyday. most people here don't think twice about it."	4	4		1																					
461	1	"the one specific example of how the quality of life can be improved by the m.v.p in sauri, kenya is that economy life in the saurian communities can the expandation of the healthcare can be improved in sauri. in this article the author made it convincing that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime because the goal of the m.v.p is to make sure that everything in suari is acomplished by 2015, or for 2025 for other targets. it was a good way that she put the examples in the story because she says that some goals in sauri are. getting fertilizer for plants to help them grow, so that people in sauri have food. hospitals with supplies that will help the people in sauri enough beds running water treatments electricity schools that are free for the people who can not afford to send their children supplies for the school books(that every child can have) lunch(for the children and adults) this story is very helping because it lets us know what the m.v.p is and how it helps the saurian people."	4	4		1

468	1	"i believe and have hope this could be achievable. but, this could go either way in this situation. this is not a simple task what so ever. they'd have to make a ""club"" to get the word out to americans for funding or donations. and by doing that, it does take a load from their pockets. a great way to get supplies out there in africa could be to call every local shops, stores, or whatever there is. and get them on board to give monthly supplies from their store to give to people in africa. such as sending in good fertilizer to keep them well feed and their crops healthy. including getting simple school needs & supplies. they may also get a hold of the head company, to get as much ""bed nets"" as they could. all od the above would be amazing. i've seen plenty of assocations doing this in our present time. if we really put our heart, minds, soul, time in it we could make it happen. but, the question i have to now ask: is this going to really be enough? it all basically comes back down to the main question: can we win the fight against poverty?"	4	4		0																					
471	1	"interseted in helping or charitys? i think this for you, if you are! i think poverty will still occur in the future, evidence i have to support this, maybe because the government would not have enough money to feed everyone. poverty is severe, people have experienced deaths from it. another evidence i have to support my answer is, well poverty is all over the world and charitys might not get there, poverty is still all over the earth and charitys help by donating food, water, blankets, and other certain materials. poverty might never stop since some countries are struggling with money budgets. also, some countries donÕt much food and poverty occurs in that certain place. charitys are all over the world to help places with poverty. you can help fight poverty by donating. some places have less medicine or less school materials. donating to charitys is a big help, so if you have a few extras go donate to a charity and youÕll be helping!! i think poverty is very risky for lives, people all around the world every year die from: hunger, diseases, and water shortage. giving medicine to hospitals are very helpful, so patients can get healed or feel better faster and faster. building schools and handing food will be great for children and parents. schools shouldnÕt be charged to go to school. education is important, so no more school fees! parents work very very hard to let their kids have an education, because their kids mean it all to them. starting a charity will also help. people all around the world still struggling through hunger and water shortage. the world needs to stop poverty. itÕs not fair that we get mostly every thing, and poor countries out there donÕt. some parents even work all day just to get a bed net for their kids, so they donÕt get malaria. malaria is also a severe disease. bed nets costed $5, thatÕs at least a weekly salary! before, there wasnÕt any electricity. there werenÕt any machines or video games to play with people really did struggle and have a series conflict. some people are too poor, they didnÕt even get a meal. they have little huts or none of all to sleep in. children who couldnÕt afford school had to do chores with their parents. they did such as fetching water and wood, so they could live. these people donÕt deserve this, no one does! we could help stop this!! some countries are grateful to have food, water and electricity. also grateful they could go to schools without paying school fees. some are also grateful to have doctors and medicine to cure sickness and diseases."	4	4		1																					
472	1	"the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime. in the two paragraphs called, Òa better life-2008,Ó it says that the hospital now has has free medicine for all the most common diseases, which would include malaria. just having free medicines that are proven to cure diseases like this may not seem like much, but i remember reading about an award winning book called ÒfeverÓ and it was about the disease malaria. it was a story with fictional characters, but it still included much information about malaria. aside for the hospitals now having a care to sicknesses like malaria, there are now bed nets in every area of sauri, as it says after the free medicine. just to think that these people in this place that used to have hardly any treatment, no doctors, no water or electricity, malaria infected mosquitos, dying crops, few school supplies, itÕs an amazing comparison when you think about think about how many people have been helped, how many problems have been fixed. (the fight for better health/water, fertilizer, knoledge.) now, they also have bed nets that will literally Ònot let the bed bugs bite.Ó people much feel so much more relieved to know that they have better safety and protection while theyÕre sleeping. so, now people have medicine, they have sleep, but they also need food. that problem has been adressed, too. after the author talks about medicine and bed nets, they say that they now have fertilizer, seeds, and tools to grow better crops and keep them under control. this is a very important problem and it has been adressed and fixed. all of it adds up to a better life. i mean, the problems arenÕt fully fixed and thereÕs much more poverty in the world. but, this a good start and the author clearly states that many things have been changed for the better in sauri. we are most definately capable of doing more work. we just all need to work together. millenium villiages has definately proved that we can make big improvement and thereÕs always room for more."	6	6		1																					
473	1	hannah sachs and her dad went to kenya africa. and they had no education no food and there cloths were tattered. and some people had poverty they were poor. but than the united nation built a program called (mvp). which stands for millennium villages project. that united nation built was in kenya africa. it costed money to be in the program. the cost of the program was a dollar a day. some people couldn't afford it so the just stay home do work. like carrying bucket of water to grow the crops and stuff. but they don't feed them at millennium villages project. they only give them a education. hannah felt bad for does people she said it just want to make her cry. it was hard for them live even know they don't have any food and stuff or no electricity or water. better life they made a change and said that this would happen. they will give them seed and fertilizer and they gave them free lunch in kenya africa. there will be no school fee's no more and millennium villages project. so that made them happy and educated non-starveless. millennium villages project has come over 80 cities. first they had no beds now they have beds. they had no water now got water. there was no electric now they have electric. there was no health care now they have health care. they had no medicine now stuff changed they have medicine. they had molora that mosquito's gave them but now they have something called bed nets. now they are not poverty. they have alot of health care. the economy is getting better than it was before. there quality of life is better than it was before. that's how stuff changed in kenya africa.	3	4		2																					
478	1	"yes it can be achievable if they had more water, fertilizer, crops, and knowlede. if they had more water less civilians would die of thirst and will live longer. if they had more fertilizer they would have more crops to grow and to pick. if the had more crops to grow with fertilizer they could eat the crops so they can be more healthy and live longer. if they had more knowledge they can go to school and graduate and go to collage and later get succesful job and be succesful in life."	4	4		0																					
480	1	"i agree that getting out of poverty can be achieved in our lifetime because the millineum project began in 2004, and in 2008 made really good progress in kenya. at first sauree was really poor. the hosptials didn't have doctors. there was only a officer. some patients didn't get treated. there was a disease called malaria that mosquitos bite you and kids can dies, quickly and adutls get really sick. the hospital didn't ahve water and eletricty. some kdis did no have education because there couldn't afford school fees. the schools had little supplies for the students, but the students wanted to learn. it was hard for the student to concetrat because there was no midday meal for the students. but the end of the day the students had no energy. when the farmers try to grow crops they couldn't because no water and fertilizer for the plants. the farmers worry about will they grow enough crops for their families the people in sauri made great progress since 2004. the hospitals had bed nets for people to keep away mosquitos, the hospitals had electricity and water, the farmers had fertilizer and water. the schools had alot of supplies food for midday meals and the parents did not need to pay school fees. the progress in sauri proves that winning the fight can be achieved in a lifetime."	4	4		3																					
488	1	"yes i think it is possible to end poverty in my lifetime, but it will be hard because when she said Òwhat it will really take is the world to end poverty,Ó it will be hard because not everybody in the world is ready to work together. but it is possible because if we fund enough money for the milennium villages project we could get rid of poverty in africa, asia, and all the other places that need our help. i think that we will face many chalenges because if malaria is a problem so is pollution, hunger, diseases, and lack of medicine. like in the article it only took eight years to fix it, think of billions of dollars going into this truly wonderful cause."	4	4		0																					
492	1	"yes, i do think that hannah sachs really convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" because her essay was pursuasive, it did its job and simply inspired me. if the whole world was to read it and get inspired, her wish would come true. she stated in the third paragraph of her essay that the mission of the millennium villages project is to get people out of poverty, assure them access to healthcare, and help them stabalize the economy and quality of life in their communities. kenya just happens to be one of the poverty areas of the world. in the time frame of about 15-20 years, comparing what we've already got done and what needs to be done, this dream can totally come true. the millennium villages project completed their mission on kenya and i suppose they will continue, all around the world. hannah wrote in her first conclusive paragraph that in just 4 years, dramatic changes have occured as a result of the millennium villages project's complete mission, in sauri. after stating all the previously serious, unfixed problems like the education and healthcare, she went ahead to say that all those problems have been fixed in just 4 years. if you look at it from an angle, that is a really, really big accomplishment. it really has made a better life for kenyans. in the second paragraph of the same section, hannah says that the millennium villages project has not only helped kenya, but also 80 other villages in sub-saharan africa. like she said, thought it won't be an easy job, it would take a worldwide effort to make the world (everywhere on earth) a much better place to live in the aspect of living comfortably and healthy in any environment. if you see it the way i do, diminishing poverty in areas like sauri, kenya won't be a hard job as long as we have determination, inspiration, and faith to believe that this can really happen. nobody on earth deserves to suffer from poverty, especially if it can easily be solved with common resources. i don't know about you, but i really do believe we can make this happen. poverty can lead to death and this is not ok! god created all men equal, and nobody deserves any better than others."	3	4		3																					
500	1	"beautiful breakthrough how would you feel if you lived in a poverty country? with no money, health care, feritlizer, medicine, school supplies, clothes and shoes? in my opinion i feel the author made a great arguement, because now in 2011 were going through an economy. in 2004 sauri made $1 a day. the millennium village project was helping the people of sauri get out of poverty, access to health care, help them stabilize the economy, get them feritilizer, get them medicine and school supplies. before that project the people of sauri didn't have much of nothing. at their hospital they were only 3 children to a bed, and 2 adults to a bed. the room was filled with patients but most couldn't afford it, or the hospital didn't have it. there were no doctors just a clinical officer running the hospital. there was no water or electricity. a disease common in africa is malaria. a pest that carries malaria are mosquitoes. something that prevents mosquitoes are bed nets, with chemicals a net costs $5 dollars, but they only made $1 a day. so almost 20,000 kids die from malaria. in 2008 the organitzation helped the of sauri."	5	5		1																					
508	1	"i think that is is possible to fight agianst poverty, it might take a cile but in the story they made a big change. my first example from the stoory is that befor those people helped them there were a lot of sick people that could not pay for medicine. now is sauri the people have medicine for free. my second exampl is in the begining the people that lived in sauri did not have fertilizer, tools for their farms, or seeds for their crops so most of them were hungry but after these people helped them they have all of thos things. now my third example is that the mallenniun villege kids had to pay for school and some could not aford it. the ones that could aford it didn't get lunch. now the school fees are free and the schools provide lunch. if we can make changes like more food, medicine, seeds to grow crops fertalizer, tools, books and much more, i think that we can do it in many more places that need soport."	5	4		3																					
511	1	"brainstorming i think that the author thinks that it is important for the kids here in u.s to learn the life before and after the millenium village project because in the text under the subtitle a better life, paragraph 2 it states that Òwhat it will really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good.Ó also i think that the author wants us to learn the life in kenya because i believe that she wants all of us to learn to help the program millenium village project because in the text before the program people were struggling over poverty in the text the project was to help people escape poverty also after the project people were able to go to school, hospitals, and farmers are able to grow their crops because in the text under subheading Òa better lifeÓ it states what happends after the millenium village project. i think that the author wants us to learn about the life in kenya before and after the millenium village project because i think the author wants us to help out people escape poverty in kenya. in the text the author states what happens before the millenium village project in the first page paragraph 3 the author states Òthe plan is to get people out of povertyÓ also before the project people were struggling in the subheading Òthe fight for better healthÓ the author states the hardships people go through because of the disease malaria, also in the subheading Òwater, fertilizer, knowledgeÓ the author states what the people and kids go through because they donÕt have the right fertilizer and irrigation also kids dont have the exact supplies they need to go to school. after the project the author states in the subheading Òa better lifeÓ paragraph 2 Òwhat it was really take is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good.Ó"	4	4		1																					
516	1	"the author did convience me about winning over provety. the author convience me because it says that even when willages didnÕt have enough money for supplies they still oferd it. in paragraph 10, a better life 2008 it says, Òthe people of sauri had made amazing progress in just 4 years.Ó more people have money to get food because there are no fees for school any more so that means more children are educated and have, a better life. there where many solutions to problems they had, like people starving because they do not have fertilizer. but know people found a way to get fertilizer they where address to fertilizer, seeds and as well tools to maintain the food supply. almost 80 villages had free charge for diseases because the hospital had medicine to cure it. i think the pople that was in sauri are very happy because of all help they had."	4	4		0																					
518	1	i think the author convinced me by the examples she said. the first example i think was good was that the kids did not afford school fees and i agree with her because some kids and familes donÕt have enough money to go on feild trips or other good events the school dose. another thing the author convinced me by is that the kids did not have good looking cloths and i agree with her because some people do not have enough money to buy good looking cloths. the last thing i agree with is the mothers did not have any strolles to put there babies in so they had to put the babies on there back. and because they did not have any. and thatÕs how the author convinced me.	4	4		0																					
527	1	"the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because the author had told me that there wasnÕt good things happening at sauri, kenya but, because of the millennium villages project sauri, kenya has now won the fight against poverty.  for example the people of sauri, kenya could not afford to pay for treatment for the patients.  another example is that there was mosquitoes and that they had carried malaria and people made bed nets that would keep away mosquitoes since they come out at night.  the people could not afford to buy this.  because of the millennium villages project the people can now have better lives because now they can afford treatment for people who need it and afford treatment for people who need it and afford those bed nets and it was a success.  i infer that the millennium has improved many lives sauri, kenya and made it easier to live.  i think that this project is very amazing and it should go on to help more people who need it people because it has done very amazing things."	4	4		1

572	1	"in my opinion, winning the fight against poverty is achievable. it all depends, though. it depends on the people, if they would be willing to give up their time and money for these people. the economy is bad. so the people can be stingy with their money. actually, even when the economy is better, some people might be protective of their money, after what they have gone through. now, i'm not saying, it's not possible, because it is. this projected started in 2004 and by 2008, the life of those who live in sauri was already better. in the four years, no money for medicine, lack of water & fertilizer for crops and even no lunch for students has changed to the opposite. to me, making poverty is history...is impossible...there are so many people who are poor. sometimes, they can't help it, or just sometimes they can't find a job. it is impossible to get rid of poverty. i think society is meant to be like this, where there would be rich people an poor people. i'll consider a one-star rated restaurant a bad job. a one-star rated restaurant where barely anybody goes in and comes out. compare that to a nice four-star rated restaurant owned by a rich person and hiring fine cooks who cook fine food. if all the restaurants in the city or town would be a four-star rated restaurant, there wouldn't be a most popular one, would there? actually...i'm bad at explaining things but what i'm saying is, there has to be a winner, and a loser. which is, the rich people & middle classed people are considered ""winners"" and the people who are poor are the ""losers"". that's how society is made like. we can change some, but not all."	6	5		3																					
583	1	"yes, the author did convnce me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". this is so because in the story, on the third paragraph she tells us how the goal is suppose to be complete by 2015 and others can to be complete 2025. although it is only the year 2012, she wrote down the sentence ""we are halfway to 2015, and the world is capable of meeting these goals,"" which convonced me that it would be done by 2015. the next sentence ""but our first glimpse of sauri showed us that there was plenty of work to do"", but it never said it was impossible to do. another reason, example of how the author convnced me that ""winning the fight (against) poverty is avhievable in our lifetime,"" because the first paragraph that talked about 2008, showed me the improvements that they had already made in 4 years, was incredible. the hospital improved and so did the defense against malaria. if they could do that in 4 years, what could they do in 11 years total? so thats my second reason/example. the last example or reason (no time) of how the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against povety is achievable in our lifetime"", because of the last sentence in the second paragraph about 2008 which states, ""but sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. that last sentence assured me that it was possible, that sentence cleared out all the buts and also's in this story for me. that is how the author convinced me."	4	5		0																					
586	1	"the author convince me ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because they help sauri, kenya. the first thing they help with is the hospital, now the hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases and has water and a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in the sleeping site in sauri. the second thing they help with is hunger crisis on the farm and the food supply, now the families can eat with out straving. the third thing they help with is the schools, now the school have no fees have the supplies they need and has lunch, now they will have energy when they go home. the fourth thing in sauri, kenya is now the people have a better life style."	4	4		2																					
589	1	"yes, i do think this is achievable in our lifetime. one reason is that if the plan is to get people out of poverty and we donÕt give up, the everybody will get out of poverty in sauri, kenya. weÕre so close so if we keep doing this we will achieve our goal. if a lot of people our not poor than we can do it by 2015 or 2025. another reason is if the world works together to change poverty for good than no one will be poor. if no one is poor the plan will have worked. if the world doesnÕt work together, then africa and other places will have little populations because of their health. one last reason is that in other people feel as sorrowful as she does, then we will reach the goal. we can donate food and money to the red cross and other things. we can also helpout by giving clothing to the poor. then we can help out at a place were they serve food to the poor. if we do all these things and care just a little more, we can make a difference in the world of poverty."	2	3		0																					
594	1	in the article it states that is a way to oversome poverty. because. millennium made materials cheap for them to use. like materials to support. cheap medicine and bed nets are good things. schools giving out lunches to students is also good. if they keep on helping kenya poverty will be reduced in sauri. it was convincing that poverty will end. millennium organization is helping kenya by supplying more and support. and will end in 2015.	3	4		1																					
598	1	"the author convience me that winning the fight against poverty is the turning point of the decline & fallot poverty.  i think that if poverty had ended with the Òmillennium development project,Ó we shouldnÕt be worry sick. the millennium project helps improve poor countries that couldnÕt compete on the global scale of economy & trades. if it isnÕt adequate or well decent enough, then we canÕt end poverty if the country isnÕt improving enough of adequately or decent wealth, food, supplies, & minerals. if we need to bring an end to poverty, we should take drastic steps & dramatic countermeasure, also included measures & more materials in the global economy. the people must work as one to ended hunger, school supplies shortage, water, & medical supplies. if we work together as one, we can make dramatic improvements and also end poverty one and for all."	4	4		1																					
604	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our outline because even poverty is in many places, it still is acheivable in many ways. my first example is in sauri, kenya in africa. they started off with having nothing but the millennium villages project gave them things they did not have as first such as food, good shelter and fertilizer and clothing. then after a while they started to get all of the supplies they needed. my next example is also many places in africa have no clean water so they get very sick. slowly, organizations are bringing clean water to african villages. i also believe that it is hard to win the fight against poverty. a reason i think this, is because poverty exists all around the world in different cases. it will be hard to end all of this, but it is still possible. this is why i believe winning the fight against poverty is possible."	5	4		1																					
609	1	"152501y3_000516827 i think millennium village project based a brighter future like the fight  for better health. the fight for better health. there were 3 kids and 2 adults. the rooms were packed with patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could no afford it. there was no doctor, onl a clinical officer running the hospital."	4	3		1																					
612	1	122691y3_000468456 i think itÕs achievable because if you believe it could happen. they should try different types of medicine. maybe a vacine. it would probably work for malaria i donÕt know it might.	5	5		0																					
618	1	"the author convinced me that was, at first they had no food, fertilizer, medicane, and Òbed netsÓ. so some kids couldnÕt go to school or get treament for diseases. like one diseases they had called malahria. you needed bed nets to help but they sticked through it untill they had the money to get what ever they need. the author convinced me to cause, they made up a program to help get the supplies for school, hospitals, and farmers. also cause they made certain years have a goal done. so that really convinced me to. and becausce certain kids couldnt go to school, they had to help their parents with chores. cause the school hadnÕt had enough school supplies and some of the parents couldnt pay the fee for some kids to go to school. and i thought that some of these diseases there having that are killing more than 20,000 kids each day is really mest up. so in 2008 itÕs getting more better each day is a miracle. like Òthe yala sub-district hospitalÓ. they got enough money to help the patients with the medicane they need. and it helps cause itÕs for free charge."	4	4		1																					
620	1	"they wrote this because the author wants us to help them to get better. 3 things that had happen before the millennium was that they had no medicine for people who were sick. they had no money, food, and supplies for the children. had a bad hospital has to sleep in a bed with 3 children or 2 adults in a bed together. 3 thingÕs that happen after the millennium was that they what can be in the hospital and electricity so you can see. had medicine for children for their mosquitoe bitÕs. children donÕt have to go hungrey anymore because you can eat in the school. you have water for the hospital. also the author wrote this part of the story so we can know how they are doing in school or in their life. im so happy that they can live better and have bed netÕs so they canÕt be bit or medicine for the people who did get bit. i hope they feel better about their new life and get well for those in the hospital in kenya."	3	4		2																					
624	1	"i think fight againist poverty is achievable, in time, because it took the millennium organization 4 years to access their healthcare, stabilize the economy, and get the millennium people medicine and school supplies. the text says that the hospitals have no water or electricity, so first the millennium organization resloved their healthcare issues. the main disease their was malarie which is caused by mosquitoes, the medicine is cheap but the millennium people make one dollar a day. the millennium organization was able to get the village better healthcare, food, electricity, better education, and their hospitals have medicines."	4	4		1																					
627	1	"the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya will improve before 201s. for example from the text : the people in sauri made great progress in just four more years. there were no longer school fees, the school is now starting to serve lunch to students in schools. hospitals has water now and has a generator to make electricity. people has fertilizer and seeds, as well as they need tools to handle their crops. the author did convince me of that poverty is achievable in the life. sauri, kenya is starting to improve by the years."	4	4		1																					
629	1	"the article Òa brighter futureÓ explained that by looking at the title that something was wrong and that they needed help many people going hungry and many people are also going sick because of a disease called malaria that kind of a disease is very contagious in africa many kids are dieing because they are going hungry and there getting caught by that disease. and many children carry that disease. and many children are in danger and need help. malaria carries mosquitoes. 20,000 kids died from the diesease each day."	5	6		0																					
630	1	"yes i think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,Ó because giving sauri kenya need more than me. for example giving sauri kenya just $5 for the bed net to preventing insenects from coming to their beds. they need hospital to surise but there is no electricity or water, and most kids are dieing for surivsion. so there only surivision is rain. they need school supplies to learn different but the only thing they have is small like books, paper, and pencils. it is so sad so i want to make a different."	4	4		2																					
633	1	"yes, it is acheivable because from 2004 when the girl first, got there the town was poor in 4 years in 2008. the things that have changed the hostpital went from not in good shape to wow! they have medicine and free charge they have electricity now and now they have more beds. the hunger crisis was address with fertilizer. with these details it's acheivable."	4	4		1																					
636	1	"did the author convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" poverty exists in many places and kill many people a year. death strikes the poor the most than the rich. i believe that yes the author did convince me that the fight againts poverty is achievable. sauri has now better health insurence and medical help. for example sachs states that ""there were 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed."" this is how life was before the millenium village progect had started. but not everything is free, they have energy and water, and medicine to the most common diseases. another example sachs states ""kids die from it (malaria) and aduts get very sick."" this means that although there is treatment for maleria, so many people were dying from it. in 2008, bed nets were in every single sleeping facility. this means that all there hard work payed off. sauri now has better farming facilities. for example. sachs states that ""their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fartilizers and irrigation."" farmers would always think if they would have enough food and if their kids would go hungry and get sick. now, they have fertilizer and seeds, and tools they needed. example, sachs states ""time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because lack of fertilizer and water."" many people were hungry and getting sick because many supplies was not there. now they have enough food to get by. this means it has worked. sauri's education has also increased over the years. for example, sachs states ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because there parent could not afford school fees."" kids could not go to school and there future would not be bright. now school there is 100% free. also, sachs states ""it was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there was no midday meal,"" kid were low in energy because they did not have annything to eat all day. now they serve luch meals everyday. school have inproved thanks to millenium village progect. i believe that yes, author has convinced me of her opinion. now that this project has helped it can contine. this is why i believe what she said is true."	4	5		3																					
640	1	"i think that this goal is achievable because in just four years they have come very far in their project. hospitals now have medicines, running water, and electricity. there are sleeping nets preventing diseases such as malaria. many kids can now attend school, and there recieve materials and food for lunch. they have come a long way in just that amount of time, so it is believable that they can come even further by 2015, 2025."	4	3		1																					
645	1	"yes, the author convinced me because in the text it states Òwe are half way to 2015, and the world is capable of metting these goalsÓ  they or she is giving hope that they are capable of this.  another statement they gave was Òbut the first glimpse of sauri showed us that theses was plenty of work to doÓ so now she is edmiting there is alout of work to be done.  but she is still keeping her hopes up.  another statement she gave was Òdramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa.Ó  this happened in 2008 at this time we are in 2012.  2008 was a very good year the country changed in good ways.  another statement was Òthere were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bedÓ.  they also state that they are in bad shape.  i know they all ready in progress.  they are working hard to save the people in poverty they are helping them eat have school supplies clothes, water, and shoes.  in my my opinion the were and are doing a great job."	4	4		1																					
651	1	"yes the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because in paragraph 9 in the first sentence it say that the sauri people made four years of progress. in paragraph 10 it says the changes have occurred in 8 villages. in paragraph 9 it says that now the hospital has electricity and water. also in paragraph 9 it says that the children can go to school and eat lunch, with out paying a school fees. i think by 2015 or 2025 most or all the people will be out of poverty. i am very happy that the people of sauri made progress. i hope the people of sauri make more progress i think the people of sauri have a better life than they had before."	4	4		1																					
659	1	"yes, it is achievable because with help from people all around the world we can help people in poverty. the more people that know about people who are in proverty than the more we can help them. we can send supplies like medicine, fertilizers and other things that they need to have a healthier and better life. people can also start fund-raisers to raise money for the poverty stricken areas and by spreading the word around, everyone can donate something to help. if everyone helps out than poverty will be gone for good. everyone can help, you donÕt have to send money just donate supplies like mosquito nets so kids wonÕt die from malaria carried by mosquitos and medicine to help sick people who canÕt afford it. every little bit counts so lets help them in anyway we can."	5	5		1																					
660	1	"i think that Òwinnig the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifeÓ if you try hard to help otherÕs you could achive it. the person who wrote this article was 12 years old when she visited kenya with her father in 2004. at that time the people of sauri lived on less than $1 dollar a day. it was a poverty witch means poor, having little or no money a all, villages get technal advice and partical iteams, such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies. a goal that they had was suppose to be met by 2015, some of the other targets were at 2025. fertilizer means a substances spread into soil that helps and supports plant growth. there was a day in 2004 when they followed the village leaders into a hospital the yala sub-district hospital. they saw 3 kids and 2 adults."	6	5		0																					
669	1	"yes. i agree that we can win the fight against poverty is achieveable in our lifetime.  as the last paragraph said, sauri has already start to shown improvement and if we, the people put our heads together and truly want to help countries that are fighting against poverty, we can make a change. going back on the topic of sauri the changes after the four years was huge! the 2004 hospital with patients that couldnÕt afford or didnt have treatment back then has changed! they now have medicine, thatÕs free of charge, and they have it for all of the most common dieseases! the problem with no running water and electricity has also been fixed with water connected to the hospital and a generator for electricity. bed nets are also avaible in every sleeping site in sauri with also decreases the amount of people getting sick and needing medicine. thatÕs only a part of the change that has been made also! next is the hunger crisis. back then: poor outcomes of crops, lack of fertilizer and water, farmers worrying if theyÕll have enough food for their family. after the four years, boom!, a huge change, people are given now with fertilizers and seeds and also tools to maintain the food supply. that also means less sick people in ways! my last topic education, back then school wasnÕt availible for most kids since the fees were too expensive and/or they had to help their family with chores. even people who could go to school had little supplies which weigh them down from learning even if they wanted to. addition of another food problem of kids getting tired from lack of the midday meal. once again, a huge change has been made! there are no longer school fees and the school now serves lunch! thanks to that the attendance rate of kids getting education is going up also! this is why i believe that winning the fight against poverty is possible. in a minimum of 4 years such big changes were already made in sauri, so why not other places? we can win. we can if we try. if we dont many places will be be ruined. families lots of things. yes, we can!"	4	4		3																					
671	1	i think we will not win the fight against poverty in our lifetime out i also think we will if we do not spend so much money on things we don't need. like a example is that in the story it said there is no school fee but also it says the hospital is giveing the medicines alway for fee so i am wondering how they are makeing money. also how are they going to pay for medicines and school supplies another example of why not is how they going to pay the electricity bill to keep the generator going in the hospital if no one is pay for the things they need. another example is that there is 80 other villages with the millennium village project going on but like i said before how the going to keep the fight against poverty going if no one is paying for anything or if no one got any jobs to pay for any thing they need to keep there family safe from danger. am also wondering how are they going to pay for other villages around the world if there spending so much money on one place. they me guess there going to take more money from my mom and other people that have to pay bills.	4	4		1																					
684	1	i think the author thinks kids in the united states should learn how life was in kenya before and after because they did not have a lot of things like we did. when the project was done they have more things they can use now. one example of kenya and what it was like before the project was done is many people did not have shoes to wear. another example is they did not have enough beds for everybody to lay in. the third example is the hospital did not have any doctors. in this story i learn a lot of things and how they did not have the things we had. also in this story learn that you never know that could be you or your family or one of your family member in that situation.	4	4		1																					
690	1	"yes the author did convince me that winning a fight against poverty is achievable in this liftime, but i also know that sometimes it takes more than four years. it really didn't talk alot about that in the article. i mean after all you just can't go snap (interjections) and all the problems in sauri are taken care of. it wakes alot of time like for examaple you have to find more jobs for people to do than that takes care of sauri's money problems, then you have to raise for medicines that takes alot of time and work and after all the people in sauri don't have alot of money for taxes so you really can't win. plus there's many more problems in sauri and just those two problem would take more than four years. plus in this storie they were trying way to hard trying to convince me to belive them like how the girl said ""it makes me so sad and oh ""the poor farmers their crops are dying how kids can't go to school and how all these kids are dying. than at the ending they're talken about now they're done in four years later, it's weird because usally their trying to get you to buy something thats why i have mixed feelings about the story"	5	4		0																					
692	1	"i think the author gave a convincing aregument about how if we all work together we can help. i think yes we can achievable in our lifetime by sending in money to pay for the medican and bed net, and ferlizer for the farmers. it could also be possible because they are alredy doing much better and it's all redy been 4 years. another way this could be possible to help them if people from other countreys are willing to help and send in money. finlley we can reach this goal by letting everybody know what is happening in kenya, africa and offley let will pass the message and help out."	3	3		0																					
693	1	the story i read about talked about villages in africa didn't have good schools and hospitals. the kids couldn't really go to school because their parents pay for it because of the fees. the hospital was even worse because they did'nt even have a real doctor helping the patients. they also did'nt have any running water to drink. the also did'nt have any electricity so the could'nt see what diseases or bites etc. the patients had to sleep in the bed but they got muscito bites which led to diseses. after 4 years everything changed the kids go to school for free. and patients get treated for free at the hospital.	4	4		0																					
698	1	"yes, because most people have over 4 years lifetime and from the article the progress was wonderful. they article said ""the attendance rate went up"" and before the it said ""there were barely any people going to school. then the other problem was that they had a school feed no one wanted to pay for or could no one could afford it but now there is no fees at all so now everyone can go and enjoy for free and get a great education. also now the attentends rates are up. as well as that they have ""water connected to every hospital now i bet everyone has a great life thanks to this program and if all of this can happen in 4 years if it is only about 20 places that is only 80 years and most people live that long."	3	3		1																					
699	1	"yes because people have hospitals to keep health & schools to keep people educated & farms, food & crops to help them stay healthy. it is also good to have the bed nets because it will provent them from having a horriable desease such as malaria. the on ething sauri, kenya needs to have is money, because if they don't have money it would be hard to survive. it is also good to have running water without that you wouldn't be able to survive. another good thing is you have medicine without that you could die or get more sick then you are now. you guys are doing a great job surviving."	6	6		1																					
709	1	"i think that the author did not convene me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"" because (1)  in the ""text"" kids  and familys in poverty cant  even  afford  to go to school and get an edgucation (2)  yet  20,000 kids die each day by getting the ma laria disease, beecause they  cant afford a bednet. each net is $5 they make $1 a day .(3) kids cant get  there own hospital bed, they share a bed with 3 people . also  adults , 2 aldults per bed, so how can we expect to end poverty by 2015 if we cant end poverty now? no lunch for kids , no crops for farmers, how will they live? it cant be possible. can it?"	5	5		1																					
715	1	"yes, because when they were in need of water, fertilizer, and knowledge they got all of the stuff that they need. more people is going to school. the farmers are now planting crops for kids to eat. the water is going to the hospital. and all the medicine is free. but in the first pg they was talking about how they do not eat but now tey eat at school have power at the hospital how they can see what they are doing to people now. but the farmers are have a good time with seeds and fertilzer. there are not as much people dieing now because some of the stuff is free now."	4	4		1																					
717	1	"by the time i get old, i answer the question yes because that can be really true and posable to be able to organize something were not one person be pore i wish that know one was pore but sometimes thatÕs just the way it is. to back up what im talking about in the decusion: the people of sauri hold made progress now if anyone who could do progress to get back on there feet some how live can chang the world by building homeless shelters and taking people to church and even kids who has clothes thatÕs old they should give to the pore because they donÕt even really know what itÕs like to have fresh knew cloths. a other thing to support what im saying is the dramitic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan afric. i also think that we can make it better for the pore people by getting the president to sign a contract saying that we will build special homes for them, and we will get better education by giving children great school supplies, and computeres so they can get more knowledge. thatÕs the way i think i can make the world a better place for the homeless people and for the kids to get better education."	4	4		0

752	1	"the author didnÕt quite convince me that Òwinning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. i say this because there are so many villages, (80 villages) and with so many in poverty and there are more and more people everyday, this could be really hard. they can hardly afford things like paragraph 3 Òa fight for better healthÓ is states that the bed nets are $5Õs each and that is very expensive. they need lots of money too, because with about 20,000 kids dying everyday because their parents canÕt afford bet nets. millennium villages project has already given and given them things like fertilizers, medicines, and school supplies but these still havenÕt gotten these villages out of poverty yet, so as you can see things are hardly getting better. also, people worry all the time about will they have enough food? or will their kids become sick and hungry? but what they really should be asking is when will the millennium villages project actually help achieve improvished villages? i say this because it states how children canÕt even concentrate, and how they become weak by the end of the day, so the millennum villages project mist better themselves so that they can not only convince but prove that priverty is achievable in our lifetime."	3	4		1																					
754	1	"yes, winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime because in 2004 when they had went to the yala sub-district hospital they had 2-3 patients in one bed and the people were not getting the medicine they needed because they either could not afford it or the hospital didnÕt have it. now in 2008 they have the medicine they need & water & electricity is connected to the hospital. another example is that they could not grow crops because they didnÕt have enough water or fertilizers so they would worry if they would have enough food for their whole family. now the food crisis has been adressed with fertilizers & seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain food supply. another example is that most kids did not go to school because their parents could not aford the school feas even though the kids really wanted to go to school. now there is no school feas and the schools serve lunch for the students & the attendence rate is way up. another example is that the children would be with their mother either on their back or running around barefoot with other children & since ther is no school feas the children are able to go to school. i think that if the people keep working hard they will be able to reach other goals."	5	4		2																					
756	1	the author convinces me to say yes because if sauri can come out of poverty in four years we can to. they had dried up crops. they also had school rates they also didnÕt have bed nets now they have them in every sleeping facility. even the hoipital is up to date they have a generator and water now there  no school fees. even the hunger crisis is gone. the goals are supposed to be met by 2015 by half of them are done already. they now have to tools to maintain the food supply. farmers have fertilizer and seeds to support their family. the school has lunch for the kids. they now have medicine for almost all common diseases. in school sauri kids could not concentrate because there was no midday meal. there was no food to give them so at the end of the day they were exhausted. but 4 years later that all changed when they had a evening meal and they werenÕt exhausted when the got how. so if sauri can come out of poverty  in four years were they had barely enough food. so imagine what we can do to the world by 2015. so come on america if they can do it so can we so come and lend a helping hand to anybody.	4	4		2																					
763	1	"i think the goal of poverty can be achieved because they plan to get it reached by 2015. what does that have to do with it? everything, because like in the text, she was saying they would accomplish the goal of getting more food and supplies. in 2008 they accomplished a lot! so imagine 2015 when they can eat whenever and wherever. so by the time iÕm about... 15. imagine what they would have by then. when they were saying it was a war, they probably thought of it that way because they are poor and struggling. their goal is achievable because they already improved in 2008. so if they keep striving like in 2008, as said in the text, they could get farther. plus in the text she said, we have made an amazing progress over the next four years. and there are still 7 more years to go. their goal basically is to end their hunger and help people reach a better health. so food is an important think because by the end of the day without a midday meal, imagine how much energy you have lost. a lot right? so that is one of their most important goals in their lives."	4	4		0																					
787	1	the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in their lifetime because they did things like plan to get people out of proverty by assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities.  also three kids to a bed 2 adults to a bed saves space and money so they will not have to be poverty. it took 4 years but now water is connected to hospitals.  i infer they will not be proverty.  god will help them not have little mony.  it reminds me of what haiti and their place was messed up.	4	4		1																					
791	1	"yes the author convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" in 4 years, they turn a poor country in to a better country. they stop charging fees for school. now more kids can get an education. hospitals have more medicines and bed nets. farmers have water and fertilizer. i have been convince because of they're progress."	4	4		1																					
795	1	the author did convince me that winning the fight aginst poverty is achievable because the millennium villages project has already increas the attendance of childrens going to school and the parents do no longer have to pay for school fees. hospitals now have water connected to them they also have genorator for electricity they also give medicine free of charge. framers also have better fertillizer for their crops now they can feed their whole family. most sleeping sites have bet nest to keep away mosquitoes that crarry malarial.	4	4		2

814	1	"yes the author convince me that Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ is an achievable in our life time because in the begginon and the middle of text was talking about how we were poor and how we did not have money but back then they were saying the did not have enough supplies for mostly anything so thatÕs why kids, people, animals was sick and thatÕs how they die. but back then we did not have that much as we do now because now its like over millions of people in the wourld but now we have supplies, house, tv, and light, back then we did not have hospitalÕs up to date no cures for anything and thatÕs why people died for no reason because they did not have anything to cure it but now we are up to date and not many people now of that type of matter because we have more supplies and then if we run out of stock we order more supplies so we can help more people. so yes i think the author convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time."	4	4		0																					
832	1	"i think that the author wanted for kids to read and understand what life was like before the millenium villages project is so that they can learn how to appreciate more of what they have because some people dont  even get lunch in sauri. the farmers there worried about if their plants were going to survive because they depend on that food so that they can servive and get throgh poverty. it was hard in sauri kenya before the melinium villages project, like people in the hospital couldnÕt get their treatment that they need if they didnÕt have enough money for it, the children at school didnt worried about it their crops and if they would survive. but nit the people in sauri have money for the hospital treatments, the farmers donÕt worry about their crops because they have water to help their plants live, and the children in the schools get lunch and its all thanks to the millenium villages project."	1	1		2																					
835	1	134501y2_ 000491416 yes the author convince me that we could win the fight against poor because we could donated thing to them Ð one example is give money for they can afford their child to go to school another example is that the fire doctors for they can take care of the sick ones- finally another example is donated food for they wonÕt die from storvefation and so yes we think that we could win the fight against the poor.	5	5		1																					
840	1	in my essay i am arguing that yes kenya can stop proverty. i have about some ways that it will come ture. so keep reading. one reason that i think kenya will stop the proverb is that they had change since 2004-2008. around that time every thing change. it use to be a poor place. but it change. use to be hosple that have no medicene or that people cant afford it. but it change. for the change is now the hosple has medien of no charges. school are free for all kids. it use to be that you have to pay for child to goto school. lunchs at school. before there were no lunch and the kids are terid and have no energy. now to the other thing that changd. now there are tools for framing and fertilizer and food to grow food. also water for the plants and people. and they has electricity.	4	4		2																					
846	1	"the author did convince me. one thing the author wrote that convinced me was that the hospital had no water and electricity, the crops were dying and kids cant go to school. another is more people is help but it wont be eazy. also the kids had tattered clothes."	4	4		1																					
850	1	"the author did convince that winning the fight agansit poverty is achievable because the yala sub-district hospital has medicine free of charge for all the most common diseases. the water is connected ot the hospital, that also has a generator for electricity. they made the progress in four years. bed nets are used in every sleeping site meaning i will prevent malaira."	5	5		1																					
852	1	"yes, the author convinced me because she says there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students shows sauriÕs progress. for example,  at first sauri lived on less than one dollar a day, but now they still might not have a lot of money, but their healthy, safe, and have better lives. many kids in sauri didnÕt attend school because their parents could not afford school fees, now there are no school fees. in 2008 the hunger crisis was addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. i think sauri has made their goals and have made process as far as the food crisis, schools, and lunches, now they are safe, healthy, and certainly have better lives. also i think the effort was great that the people of sauri, kenya made, it helped a lot of people in sauri. sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime, and i hope it stays like that for centuries, so they wonÕt be or have poverty. i think this will run through the sauri history."	5	5		1																					
868	1	"i believe that being a little more specific, winnin the fight against poverty in most of africa would be possible in my lifetime. given how quickly sauri recovered, with a little cooperation the recoveries could happen. africa has many resources, and it just needs a small push to get going. but there are many obstacles to overcome. for example, electricity. there are very little valuable things like electricity in africa. nobody can afford it, not even hospitals this causes gigantic problems.  it means there is no instant communications, no computers, no gadgets, or even things we take for granted, like electrical clocks. thatÕs just one example. there is also a great lack of water and fertilizer for plants. every harvest season, people wonder if there will be enough food for everyone. farmers ask themselves if there will be enough food for their family alone. hunger is a huge threat. many children arenÕt educated. this adds to the downward spiral. if people arenÕt educated. other, more learned people will take advantage of that. the children want to learn. they just donÕt have the time, always helping their parents. they donÕt have the money, being poor. and they donÕt have the energy, not having lunch. despite all the obstacles, though, the peopleÕs will is what matters most. as long as it isnÕt broken, they will persevere into better times. that is why i believe it is possible."	6	6		1																					
872	1	"yes i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because i think the people in the united states will help provide bed nets, medicane, fertilizer, and food for them so they will not have to continue to have to save a dollor for five days just to earn $5 to get a bed net instead of eating for 5 days. another reason why i think because some people are willing to give up five dollars to the people out in africa to help them get a bed net and to prevent them from being poverty. i think if people are willing to give up five dollars to the people in africa they will get medicane for their sickness and will have supplies for their children also they will be able to put their children in school and wouldnÕt have that much money to pay for school. for example: their was no running water or electricity in the hospitals and there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. it was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there was no midday meal.  by the end of the day, kids didnÕt have any energy. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the millennium villages project. there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. the goals are supposed to be met by 2015. some other targets are set for 2025. we are halfway to 2015, and the world is capable of meeting these goals. but our first glimpse of sauri showed us that there was plenty of work to do."	4	4		1																					
874	1	"the author did convince me that winning the fight of poverty is achievable in our life time. i think this because working together is important. the people in sauri, kenya work together, and in just 4 years they got what they wanted. at school, they serve lunch to the kids know. in the hospitals they got water. they also got medicine for free. they even got bed nets, every bed has one in sauri know. also the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools that are maintained for food supply. finally they got electricity too. so i think if we work together our world would be a better place."	6	6		1																					
881	1	"yes, i think we can defeat poverity if we work together. we have to work together to win the fight against poverty. Òthere are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished.Ó Òit will not be an easy task. as the texts states that will not be an easy task but we can do this. Òit was not in good shapeÓ it states that the hospital was not in good shape. the hospitals hap not electricity or water if we fix that they can help more patients and not let people die from diseases such as malaria and other diseases that exist in africa. if we have cleaner water we can have less mosquitos that bring malaria and bite kids and adults. Òwhat it really takes is for the world to work together to change poverty. stricken areas for good.Ó if we do what the text states we can help alot of people in need. if we help others then they will help others in a chain.Ó sauriÕs progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverety is achivible in a life time.Ó"	4	4		1																					
882	1	"i think that proverty can be solved or improved. the example i chose the goal they were surpose to go get or meet at in 2015. that coal was to give the farmers and people in kenya i fertilizer food more. i think proverty can be solved because they convinced me from the goals they are trying to meet but on the other hand it is kind of hard to be convinced because 2015 is only 3 years from now thatÕs not that long to do a big job like that and thatÕs why it is very hard to believe something like that. but iÕm going to keep my answer which was i was convinved that they can improve poverty not in that amount of time but i think they can improve it in 15 years and have a lot to spare, mabe they can even try to improve the whole contry with clean it up and make homes. that would help and then kenya would be improved, in fact kenya is not the only contry in africa that has poverty in fact i think all of africa has poverty and needs help. i know 1000 kids die from malaria each day in africa. africa is not the healthiest continent in the world. it is a tragedy about what has been happening to africa, earthquakes, floods, and many more natural disasters. if i could i would go there and help. but we can all help not by going there but actually cutting back on gas it pullote the air and what goes up must come down. also oil is a big problem if it spills in the water it goes to the drinking spot. they donÕt have filters they drink right from the river and thatÕs another problem all the bacteria and dirt goes right into there bodys and the died from that two. they need help and we can give it to them it starts with you."	5	4		0

887	1	"this story, about the millenium village project, really convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ the people of sauri recieved better health, education and a better life. they got many people out of poverty, help them stabilize the economy, and emproved the community overall. back in 2004 many of the villagers were sick and many of them were not able to pay for medicine and the hospitals didnt have treatments for the diseases. the economy was bad and it was hard to do something about it. the hospitals had no running water and electricity. one of the most common diseases, was malaria which was caused by misquitos. people couldnÕt even afford a $5 net because they were living off a $1 each day. many people were on the verge of death, until the project raised enough money to supply the hospitals with medicine, water, and electricity without charge to the people. this project was also able to provide a better education. since many people were in poverty, they couldnÕt afford to go to school to get an education. so instead they stayed at home performing chores such as getting water and food. this project encouraged kids to go to school, which they didnt need to pay for anymore. the school now serves lunch which will help the studensts focus more and get a better education. many of the villagers didnt have enough food the feed their families, because they were very poor. their crops were dying because they didnt have water systems and fertilizer to help the plants grow. many kids became hungry and sick, with no food to eat or very little. without food, the kids had no energy to do other things. ever since 2008, there have been many changes to the problems they had. fertilizers and planting seeds have been distributed along with tools to help the plants grow. the food supply is enough for the family to eat. you see, this project has changed many lives. it helped the village become better."	4	5		3																					
892	1	"i think we can eliminate poverty because, time passes and we can send money to towns, country or citys that are poor and destroyed and maybe we will have more builder to rebuild places that are poor. some people that have money go to those poor towns to donate money and food to them, anybody can participate to donate to them. people that are poor sometimes gather up there foods to share with others. powerful people like to help others to find shelter and to get some-thing to eat. poor people say ÒnoÓ when people want to help them (some-times). kids donate them selves too they only give out toys that they donÕt need any more. we donÕt just donate to one town we to other towns that need our help too and when we need help they give out stuff to us so if we help them they are going to help us. so every poor town need our help to keep them alive."	5	5		0

967	1	"fixing the world, hopeless based on the article, the author didnÕt convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achiveable in our lifetime.Ó one reason itÕs impossible is because u.s.a barely has good economy so how will africa be able to grow their economy. second, everybody in the world these day are selfish and greedy. finally, god said through the bible that there was going to be poverty in the world. because of those various reasons i believe that that author didnÕt convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó the first reason is that u.s.a doesnÕt have a good economy so why will africa. one fact is that the africans get paid 1 dollar a day. for example, the bed nets cost 5 dollars and they get paid 30 dollars a month. so 1 bed net would cost the 1/6 of their monthly payment."	6	5		1																					
968	1	"i think that the goal that the millennium village in sauri, kenya set is achievable if people from all around the world help and donate money or items. people in kenya may be poor, but people in america, china, and other countries arenÕt. they could help donating. i think she does convince me that it is achievable. the reason why i believe in her, is because she already had so much change from 2004 to 2008. Òthe people of sauri had made amazing progress in just four years.Ó they had made so much progress in just four years, by having free medicine, running water and electricity, fertilizer, seeds, bed nets, and tools. the schools doesnÕt charge money anymore and they have free lunch to all the students. people had stopped having malaria because of all the bed nets that the millennium project have provided. Òbed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri.Ó that have brought a major change to sauri, espicially the children, because children used to die every day of malaria, and people didnÕt have enough money for medicine. the farmers didnÕt have to worry anymore, about the crops, because they have fertilizer and running water. their families wonÕt starve, and the children wonÕt get sick. Òthe hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools to maintain the food supply.Ó i think the project is already changing lives. so, in conclusion, i really think the goal is achievable. they already had amazing progress. if everyone helped, they would no longer be poor."	5	4		1																					
970	1	"yes, this article convinced me that, Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó reading about the amazing progress the people of sauri have made in just 4 years persuades me to think that proverty across the world can come to an end. hospitals without meds or a doctor can work towards medicine for most common diseases, free of charge like the yala sub-district hospital did. children who arenÕt educated because of feeÕs and charges can now go to school without worring about funds, like kids in sauri, keya did. farmers who cant afford fertilizers. so they can grow crops to feed their families can raise money for fertilizers, with the help of everyone. this article makes, me apprechiate what i have more! because even though were going through a recession, itÕs still isnÕt bad as poverty in keya as well as other parts of the world."	5	6		1																					
976	1	"yes, because if they have to battle and take care of family's they should either get more jobs or upgrade there bussinesses. there supply has shrunk either because people are'nt working hard enough or people keep dying or it's just that they dont wont to work cause it's to hard/to tireing. they could have treatments to cure malaria but since they might not bedoing what there economy needs to do. they are not going to get paid and they are not going to keep a family in place. the main thing they should be concerned about is a civil right to an education! because you people never know what the people in africa could think of when they get smarter than could make bussinesses make jobs for other people come up with there own medicines to cure malaria cure lepracy all those things they could come up with. i just hope and pray that they will have a better life, and fight poverty."	4	4		0

978	1	"i think that the author wanted to tell kids about kenya because the author wanted to inform to us about why we are needed to help poverty continents like africa and what they go through. also because the author wants us to learn that helping other people, can change their lives. kenya was a poverty city in africa that did not have a lot of things, kenya people wore tattered clothes and had no shoes. kenya had a hospital that was in bad shape. this hospital had no running water, electricity, and no doctors. also the hospital had no medicine treatment that would help people. kids had to share beds and so did adults. people could not afford some treatments. malaria, from mosquitoes affected people also. people did not have net-beds to stop the mosquitoes and no medicines to prevent malaria from affecting them. farmers had no fertilizer or water to grow crops because they did not have the money. people were dying from hunger, parents could not afford school fees, and their were no school supplies. also even when kids went to school, they had trouble consentrating because they did not have meals at school. this all happened in 2004. now, 4 years later the year of 2008, things began to change. water was connected to the hospital, bed nets were at every site, the hospital had medicine and free charge, a generator was in the hospital for electricity, farmers had tools now, fertilizer, water, school supplies was in schools, and they had meals. so now you see how kenya changed one step at a time."	4	4		3																					
984	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? many countries are going into poverty, so the millenium development goals were created, the were created to help countries go out of poverty. i say, we definetly can win the fight against poverty. if we have a population of about 3 million people who aren't in poverty, if they could donate $5 dollars, we we would have $15 billion to save the world. the villages in poverty will have food, money, and doctors. if every year, everybody can donate $5, in 2 years, we'll have 30 billion dollars. some people may say that not everyone wants to donate $5, but then again, maybe richer people can pay more. instead of donating money, they can donate food, clothing, and toys. instead of using the donated money to buy things not as important, people can't donate them. we can also donate school supplies for kids and toys for their entertainment. people say that, some people are greedy and act highly of themselves who rather throw away things than donate them. i say, we can encourage kids to donate their toys, instead of parents. people may say that if it took 4 years to fix 80 villages, it will take very long to fix the whole world, and we don't even know if anyone wants to donate. i disagree with this statement because, with the help of our citizens, we might actually help more villages in less time, and with more people involved, it will actually be a sucess! so with all the help of people and donations, i think we can win the fight against poverty. if we can have people offer to help, to donate, we can make our world go out of poverty. we can even encourage kids to donate, and have people visit the villages to cheer the kids and encourage people to keep fight. together, we can make our world a better place."	4	4		0

1028	1	"the fight against poverty in our lifetime is that in africa thereÕs some of the people are dieing because malaria, it happens when a mosqoitoes that carry it, and people who do not have a bed net can get it so if the had one they will not get, but it cost 5$. they canÕt buy one because they get less than a $1 dollar a day, and they are trying to make a better communities by assore. then to heath care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities."	4	6		0																					
1034	1	"i think winning the fight is achievable because people will start giving money, food, antery, and fertilizer. 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. the nets they have cost $5, thatÕs a good price. kids get hungry and become sick. we need doctorÕs so when people get sick or have a heart attack you can call a doctor. kids lose their energy by the end of the day. malaria is a common disease in east africa. the school ahs a minimal supplies like books, paper, and pencils."	4	4		1																					
1037	1	"yes, i am convinced very well by the author because of many reasons. she told me the people came from dead crops to living crops when given fertilizer. also, she said that people had little to 1 dollar a day. then, schools had fees to be paid and hospitals didn't have the right tools or money wasn't paid. she was right, it's hard and it will be even harder in the future. i agree with the author the road is a hard one. with almost 80 villages taking 4 years with one it will not be easy to complete at all. if we stop poverty we may be able to stop all common illnesses. now that sauri is better they have water in hospital. students are left with no energy at the end schoool but did change, now schools give lunch and stop no energy for all students. now i think the author will stop tattered clothes and give new clothes in or on or before 2015 and 2025. this shows us that we can stop do it if we all help in africa we can come to world health meaning that we live longer by helping another. so, i agree fulling with the author, hannah sachs, we can help start a change, we stop poverty. we can stop this problem. we can end this, we can save kids and elders. we can save the world. if we stop hungry kids, people won't worry about death and sicknesses. we can end world problems."	4	4		2

1049	1	"the author persuaded me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime because based on the article, she explained the beginning and the problem and explained the goal of the project and explained how it was solved in 4 years later and also explained the improvements too. in the article, the author provided specific examples of how life can be improved by the millennium village project and according to what i have read and the information i got, i could say that the project has helped a lot by solving the malaria problem, providing medicines for the hospitals and improving the health care. not only that, the project helped provided water for the plants and crops, providing fertilizer for the crops that was grow in farm and help improve. schools in kenya and also help provide food and education free of charge and also made the hospital free of charge without any fees. with all this improvement, kenya must be doing a great and successful job in education, health and economics problem and up till today, the millennium villages project are still working on the project and they are willing to see great progress and reach their goal in 2015 or 2025 which is more than a life time to the author and the association of the projects. by now, even though we are half way to reach the millenium villages project goal in 2015 or 202, i would take it like they have already reached their goal and they reached it as soon as possible. if the millenium village project association keep up the god work and keep on progressing every year, i bet kenya would be one of the most healthy country in africa. the progress and helping kenya stop proverty in about 2015 or 2025 has worked and i was really convinced because the proverty the author saw on 2004 is now history (as said in the article) and i am really impressed and convinced that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."	5	5		1

1059	1	"it is achievable because even though they were hard times in sauri the yala sub-district hospital had medicine for most common illnesses there were like in sauri. so what convinced me in par the better life - 2008 made me think that there was a chance for less kids to die each day because at first i thought that nothing would happen because if all there problems from paragraphs 1, 2, 3 but now i see that now that yala sub-district hospital is now going to have more help now that there helping other people in sauri and that to tell other people that there is hope for unfortunate people and that they should come to sauri, kenya to help beat poverty and illnesses. so now i thin that now in 2012 that every day kids and adults in sauri are now happy and joyful that they have been cared for and know that there are people in the world who can help you beat poverty and illness. so if you take a trip to africa come to sauri and help everybodyÕs lives a better place to live in. and more that the author convinced me about is that sauri had a little help from nets but not enough to kill the illness but it could not stop kids from dying each day. and that now with the help of the hospital kids do not starve to death or wear tattered clothing and now kids are wearing clean cloths and stomachs full just because of people who cared and the hospital because without the hospital more kids would have died each day."	4	4		1

1070	1	"i beleive that the millennium project can help stop poverty in kenya. the reason is because they did already enough for sauri in 4 years. if the project can do that many things to help, then it can do more to even with other poor places. during 2004 sauri was it-was in poverty surprisingly when thereÕs visitors the celebrate celebrate- they seem happy even when theÕre poor. people had torn-up; tattered clothes, bare foot which makes it more possible for them to get infected. the buildings in sauri were probrobly filthy & dirty. those are bad conditions for schools, markets, especially homes, & hospitals because if these conditions will allow sicknesses to spread. if the hospitals are torn-up & filthy it will be hard for a pacient to recover because air can be contaminated & the pacient make much process. plus they barely have medicine & no doctors. schools canÕt even  provide students with food because they have no money since students barely go to school. this makes it hard because they didnÕt get a proper education since they had to work to have a place to live in. within 4 years the millennium project has fixed major problems in sauri. for example, they provided students get a better education. with a proper education they can be able to get a good/better job making them get better things in life. another is that they have medicine, water, & proper condition for hospitals curing more pacients of diseases such as malaria. they also have food for the people with seeds that they can plant to have more food & fertilizer & tools too. they did so much more helpful & useful things as well to help end poverty sauri. in conclusion, the millenium project can stop poverty in kenya & possibly for other poor places as well with what they did to help sauri as evidence."	4	3		2																					
1075	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable because with just four years, they manage to supply the hospitals with medicine to treat the most common diseases, connect water to the hospital, and generate electricity. they also managed to put bed nets in every sleeping site, which will keep the mosquitoes away, adress fertilizer, seeds, and tools to maintain the food supply, and make the schools free of charge plus free lunch. dramatic changes occured in 80 different villages across sub-saharan african. i think that if they could improve that much in just four years, then they could possibly win the fight against poverty in one life time."	4	4		2

1080	1	"based on the article i believe the author did show that this is an achievable goal. i think that the africa should be classified as inhumane currently because the poverty level is way below than it should be. when your at a place where the people of africa make less tha $1 a day and children run around barefoot, there is need for improvement. in our day and age, we as a country can raise a money. now we have singers, rappers, and acts the can raise money for a probable cause. sauri, africa has a horrible rep just for the simple fact that malaria is killing 20,000 people everyday and there is an easy cure for it. 2025 is our deadline and the author made it pretty clear that we will achieve it because with the halp of thousands of volunteers and money from all over the globe. us as a country can spread the massage around the world. the millennium village project will save africa from poverty. our deadline is from 2015 to 2025. if amaricas works as one we can achieve our goal. i believe the author clearly gives details on how we can achieve our goals. he says things like, the yala-sub district hospital is currently helping children and adults. malaria is a deadly disease that can be easily cured but every day a number of 20,000 people die from the disease. this is why he is trying to save africa's population. this disease is passed by mosquitos. so disease spreads quickly. saving africa will start a world movement. malaria kills everyday. the millennium village project can and will save millions. 2015 to 2025 is our deadline to save our goal. if we keep pushing we will achieve our goal."	4	4		1																					
1091	1	"i think since the millennium village project was successful & was done in just 4 yrs. i think in my lifetime, poverty would be ended because if projects go around to the poor people no one will end up being poor. the author says that in 2004 the first time she went, people were so poor they only made $1 or less everyday. if they cut off eatting to save money for a bed net or something they will probably die. they donÕt get good food & a $1 can buy really little. there hospitals were really bad that kids & adults had to share rooms, no source of water, so no hands can be cleaned, no electricity meaning no machines to check your heart rate, etc. crops they farmed were barely growing and dying a lot because the people couldnÕt afford good fertilizers and water was scarce. there problems could of led to hunger and maybe deaths. kids barely got eduacation because they couldnÕt afford it and if they did they had little supplies. in 2008, 4 yr.s. later sauri the hospitals had water and medicine that help treat the people. they also had a generator for electricity and bed nets were given to ever sleeping site. they got fertilizer, seeds, and tools to help them farm and stop hunger. people who work together can end and make things happen."	5	5		2

1123	1	"kenya, before and after in kenya there has been many hardships that those people have to go through. but today i learned that there is something to actually help kenya in these hard times and itÕs called the millenium villages project. this project has made and is expected to make dramatic changes in the country of kenya. alright now lets get to the real subject. well i was asked Òwhy do you think itÕs important for kids in the united states to learn about how life is in kenya?Ó. well first of all i think its important because it might encourage alot of kids to help kenya get better. when you have farmers only doing subsistence farming but their crops still wonÕt grow as well as they should, you could use all the help you can get even if it comes from kids. now second of all learning about the struggles in kenya before and after the millenium villages project could make kids like me more thankful for what they have and not take it for granted. like in kenya when you get sick theres a slight chance that youÕll be able to pay for it or even live if your severly sick. but in the united states theres alot of medicines and answers to your problems. but changes have been made in kenya thanks to the millenium villiges project. well in conclusion kenya has had itÕs struggles but like they said dramatic changes have happened like water in hospitals and medicines are there aswell. what im trying to say is kenya has had itÕs down times, but help has gotten them to the good times."	3	3		0

1159	1	"this article was about the millennium development goals and making a difference in poverty in sauri. after reading this, it has convinced me to believe that there is a chance to win against poverty in a lifetime. the article gives strong examples of the changes already made so far. sauri started off as a very poor place. for example, in this article it states that, ""at that time, the people of sauri lived on less that $1 a day"" (1). with this fact alone, it is obvious that there needed to be big changes. not only did they only live off less than a dollar, but they also had a hospital packed with sick children and adults with ony a clinical officer to aid to all of them. there was also no electricity nor running water. this sight was unbearable to the author's eyes. the majority of the sick people also had preventable diseases like malaria that could've been prevented with only a $5 bed net. it was such a simple task yet not everyone could've afforded to do it. in addition to the hospital, the author also states that, ""many kids in sauri did not attend school because their parents could not afford the fees"" (2). the handful of students that did attend school had to struggle through with only books, paper, and a pencil. they were always out of energy within the end of the day. the last thing that the author talked about was farmers. farmers always worries that they could not feed their family because they had no fertilizer nor irragation to grow crops. this was a big problem ebcause this would cause many people to die of starvation. even with all these problems, the millennium village project people worked hard to solve them. first off, they started letting electricity circulate throughout the hospital and provide medcine free of charge. that was a very big change that can prevent many people from dying. the article also states that, ""there are no school fees, and now the school serves lunch for students"" (1). this action caused many students to now attend school. the farmers also now have more seeds and fertilizer. now, there is a bed net in every sleeping site in sauri. all of this changed in only four years. this was all thanks to the milleinnium village project. with all these amazing changes that have already started to happen in sauri, how can you not be convinced? with this project, i believe that it is definitely possible to win against out fight against poverty. for this to work, i do agree with the author that the world has to work together to change this. it may not be the easiest thing ever, but it is achievable."	6	6		3																					
1164	1	"i think it is achievable because in the text the author and other people helped by providing them with food, water becausing in the text it said they did not have food and water but now they do. also they needed medicine, supplies, electricity so now that the people helped them now they have what they need. it is also achievable because if work hard we can do it to with the help of others. for example the author had help from others and the achieved the goal in just four year. i think that maybe in a couple of year that the other cuntries will also be improved if we all help and work hard to make them better for the poeple that live there. the author convinced me because if she can i can do it to. so if i work hard i can do it. i t is also achievable because if yisou take your time you can do it to. it is achievable because it said they needed many things so seens they were in poverty they could not afford then. so the author came back to sauri kenya to improve what was going on for example the hospital it had no doctor of electricity how it odes. they have a convincing article because in paragraph 3 i was sad to ehar what was going on so i thought maybe one day i could help a countrie like the author. for example in the article the kids could not go to school of eat a midday meal i thought that was sad to hear. i think the this article had a mood change it went from sad to happy bugnt this article was convicin in so many ways that i can not say them but i did wrtie some of them. i think that this achievable because if care about this people like the the author you can achive it to. this is way i think this achivable."	4	5		2																					
1165	1	"the author has done a splended job of convincing me that Òwinning the fight against poverdy is achievable in our lifetime.Ó  my first example from the text is the fact that life is sauri was so bad.  but it is very efficent now.  theyÕve convinced me that little things like $5 dollar bed nets are not easily comed by in sauri.  but theyÕre now avalible and in each home of sauri. the fact that eighty other villages have this way of life is so appaling.  the people were dying, starving, losing everything.  with a  little despenses of money here and there, all these places are now like 2008 sauari. people were so uneducated, but we now have free school in sauri.  they had no supplies or books in the schools, kids were lucky to hold a book.  now the schools are chok full of books, and have lunches for students. these examples show that we can change the way of life for the impoverished people.  we will rid the world of poverty, and tattered clothes forever.   we can, yes we can."	4	4		2																					
1168	1	yes it did. it did because he shows that around the country people need things more than people. in the text it says many kids in sauri aren't attending schools because there parents can't offord it. people in hospital need medicine but they don't have any medicine. now they got fertilizer and other things as well.	4	4		1																					
1179	1	"Òwinning the fight against poverty is achieveable in our lifetime,Ó those were the words of hannah sachs when she was just 12 years old. she believed we could win the fight against poverty, and we are. since hannah has been to kenya in 2004, four years later, they have medicine to cure diseases at hospitals, everyone has a bed net to prevent them from getting malaria, and now school is free with lunch included. the progress of sauri, kenya shows us that we can stop poverty everywhere in the world. we can prevent poverty from happening if we just worked together. we could provide little things such as shelter, water, food and medicine to help these poor people. if we just lend a hand to people in need we will have less people in poverty and more people with homes and jobs. when you help someone in need they are happy and, so are you. why donÕt you help someone today? it will improve our community and it will improve you as a person. help someone today!"	4	4		1																					
1191	1	"i believe that it is possible for the world to be free of poverty. i think that a society just being provided with simple things like medicine, electricity, and water an economy will continue to evolve. for example the amount of growth that had happened to sauri in 2008 was huge in only 4 years and i think itÕll get even better with kids being able to go to school. another way an economy can grow out of poverty is with enough food. once sauri had the tools needed food was guaranteed instead of families starving from a poor harvest. lastly i believe that you can overcome poverty with others helping. the whole reason sauri had gotten out of poverty was by the millenium project helping a little and providing necessary tools for daily life."	4	4		1

1195	1	"the author convinced me and she made me feel as if we could win against poverty. to win poverty is like a war of mosquitoes storming over you but you make it through without getting bitten. poverty makes me feel sorry for all those people out there who doesn't have a perfect home to live in, no water, no nutritions, no education, and less people work. the author made me convinced by her fighting and when she mentioned the hospital part, when there was only one worker there. i felt as if the worker is really tired out but relentless because he wants to help the people of sauri, kenya the best they can so they can get out of poverty."	6	5		1																					
1197	1	"yes, i think the author was convincing about winning the fight against poverty in a life time because in the article hanna said that after 4 years they helped 80 villages. imagine a lifetime how so many villages can be helped. if we have more volenteers we will make more progree. since 2008, things have become free, so people are able to get medicine, food, water, fertilizer, and supplies. less people get out of provety because things become affortable. kids are able to get lunches now that food is provided at school. because of this kids have energy at the end of the day. a generator is set up so people get electricity. enough electricity can be saved for medical, or lighting reasons. the author and millennium villages have tried their best to reach their goal. if they try hard less people will die and get put of proverty. before children died of a dieases called malaria. it came from mosquitoes. bed nets were to espensive since most people in sauri lived less that 1$ a day. bed nets were five dollars. in 2008 bed nets were provided verywere for people. less people have died because of malaria. the author has convinced me that the people of millennium villages can fight against poverty in a lifetime."	4	4		3

1218	1	"yes, i think that we could win the war of poverty because if they could help 80 cities imagine what the whole world could do we could maybe help all the cities in proverty because Òthey live off a dollar a dayÓ Òkids have a hard time foucusing be their hungryÓ and hospital dont have the right medicen or do but itÕs to expensive for some people to buy so people die from itÓ but if the whole world helps we will be able to get out of poverty."	4	5		1																					
1221	1	"i think we could achieve the property if we 1. try our hardest 2. be brave don't be scared 3. their not lazy. i know these are true because on number 2. in the article it said that in school students try their hardest, so i thought that it would make sense that the students wanted to try to win the property with their smart brain. for the 2nd answer adults and children were brave enough to sleep without the beds sheet, even if they couldn't afford it they are still brave enouhg to live without the bed sheet. for the 3rd answer in the text it said that ""if the children wouldn't go to school because of the parents can't affording the school feed then the child/children would do chores, so tht gave me the idea that their not lazy."	4	6		0																					
1226	1	"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our life time. she convinced me that we could win the fight against proverty, because when she started it was 2004 and in 2008 things were already getting better. the goals are supposed to be met by 2015; some others targets are set for 2025. i think there goals will be met by 2015, because if things got better in four years, things could get even better in six more years. 2025 is lots of time/years. i think that the family should get at least 1 or 2 nets for free. i think that because its not fear to them to not get paid alot, and then waste it all on the nets. they need other things too. at the time the people of sauri lived on less then $1 dollar a day. the nets cost $5. so they had to work for about a week to get a net. the kids or adult would have alread problaby died if they were that suverer. dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. 90 villages changed in only four years. so if 2015 is only six years away, 80 more more villages could get changed. there would be two more years remaining, so if 80 villages got changed in four, in two years 40 villages could get fix. by time if more of the villages need more fixing they could get fixed/changed. that another reason why she convinced me. as say said it will not be a easy task, but with everyones help and effect we could win the fight against poverty in our lifetime."	4	4		2																					
1237	1	"no, i don't think that they will win the fight against proverty because it'll take too long. also they will be poor again when theres no more money left. plus, they can't end proverty every where because they won't live long enough. proverty will go on forever. so there's no point in trying to end it. another example is that it's very hot in africa. so your going to run out of water and food. they'll be starving again. so, there's no point in helping. lastly, if they have so mch gold, they should be rich. so africa does have money. they are faking. they have plenty of money. their taking money from america."	6	5		0																					
1240	1	"yes the author convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ for and example patients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. it also made me sad. mosquitoes carry malaria and infect people by biting them. kids can die from it easily and adults get very sick. their crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. the people of samuri have amazing progress in just four year. the yala sub-district hospital has medicine free of charge for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity."	5	5		1																					
1241	1	"i think yes, because it is getting better and better after 2008. the hospital has medicine, and water and electricity are connected to the hospital. there are no school fees, and free lunch. i believe the millennium villages project will get better and better in the future."	4	5		1

1259	1	"yes, the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable is our lifetime"". the answer is yes because back in 2004, a 12-year old girl and her dad went to kenya, africa. because the united nations started a program to help sauri, kenya out of poverty. so, the 12-year old girl obserbs what it was like before the millennium and after it. thier goal was to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care, stablize the economy, and improve quality of life. thier health care in sauri was sad. there were no doctors no running water or electricity. the rooms were packed with patients that could not probably recieve treatment. it was only a clinical officer running the hospital. also no bed nets. farmers crops were dying because they could not afford fertilizer and irrigation. a family would plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops. many kids in sauri couldn't go to school because thier parents couldn't afford school fee's. the schools also needed more school supplies, and the kids had no midday meal at school. when the day ended kids had no energy. in 2008, the people of sauri made amazing progress in only 3 years. the hospitals have medicine for the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, and the hospital also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site. the hunger crisis had been adressed with fertilizer and seeds. there are no school fees, now schools have lunch, for students. dramatic changes have occured over 80 villages across sub-saharn africa. the 12-years old said when my kids are my age, i want this kind of poverty to be a kind of history. so, this is what happened after the millennium. this is why the author convinced me about poverty."	5	5		3

1280	1	"the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó quality of life can be improved by the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya. the author didnÕt explain how the millennium village project help people get out of poverty but somehow they did it. in just 4 years, the have achieved and improved a lot of things. they helped people get healthier and live a longer life which probably makes them happier.  if they achieve their goal, it could change the world by other places who are still in poverty to help them get out of it. the millennium village project helped improve the quality of life in sauri, kenya. in 2004, the millennium village project just started, their plan was to keep people out of poverty. before the millennium village project starts, sauri, kenya was having difficulties. for example, the disease that was very common in africa, was the malaria.  lots of people got the disease from mosquitoes who carry malaria. people would go to hospitals but mose patients did not receive treatment because the hospital didnÕt have the treatment or the patient couldnÕt afford it. getting rid of malaria was simple but 20,000 kids die from it each day. in 2008, things improved. the hospitals had medicine, and for all of the most common diseases were free of charge. hospitals had water and generated eletricity unlike when the project did not exist. kids did not attend school because they had not money, instead they did chores like getting water and wood. the schools would had very little supplies of books, paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn but it was hard for them to concentrate with out the midday meal. things improved later on, kids went to school for free, schools served lunch for all the students, which made the attendance rate up. families would be sad with the poor crops they built because of the fertilizer and irrigation they lacked and couldnÕt afford. farmers would be worried that they didnÕt have enough food to feed the whole family and that their kids would starve and become sick.  with the help of the project, farmers were addressed with fertilizer and seeds, with the tools to maintain the food supply. sauri, kenya is now a better place with the help of the millennium village project. i am sure that with their help, the will have a better place to live in."	3	3		2																					
1282	1	"my opinon is that its so sad that 20,000 kids die a day. the author did get my atechion by all the details. i agree with her because she's right about all those things. one thing is that how they improved with the people and hospatiles. all by working together only in 4 years. and the more they improve the better the people are. with more food better homes, and good hastapiles. with that happing there will be less people dieing each day. that's what i think about this story."	5	5		1																					
1283	1	"i think that author convinced almost everyone that read this passage that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetim.e becaus only how where going to end proverty is if we give africa some money to provide than we could probly get rid of it. as the author says ""the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years. the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases."" some people might be sending money right now helping out sauri. helping the babies making sure they don't have a diseases and making sure that they are healthy. like angalina jolie she helped africa by feeding babies and giving supplies to schools and homes. like the author said, ""the hospitals had no electricity and no water. not that much kids went to school because there parents couldn't afford school fees. so the just stayed home cleaned and fetched water."" but now kids all of sauri are goin got school sauri has finally been doing great. kids at school gets lunch now and they get power and ater and they got more supplies. some people wonder will sauri ever get stronger well by the way i see it they might get stronger than the usa. the might be stronger than the whole world. sauri is africa so it's in the middle of the desert. so that means that it's very how out there and there going to be sweating and mosqutoes are going to be bitting them. some of them mosquitoes have malirea wich means that kids and adults will die mos of the time. 20,000 kids die every day and cant do nothing about it. now every body gets a free bed nets it's this net that keep out the mosqitos. i think that sauri will make africa stronger. because there getting stronger by the moment and i think they would get out of proverty. everyone is helping them. i wonder what there doing right now"	5	5		2																					
1285	1	"the things children should know there are some reasons why i think that the author thinks that children in the u.s.a should know about how the people lived in kenya before they got halp from the millennium villages project. my first reason is that chilren should know that those people who live in kenya are poor and that they canÕt afford medical care, school for kids, water, electricity, and food. children should know that here in the usa they have almost all of these things. they are lucky they donÕt live like the people in kenya. my second reason is that the hospital in kenya doesnÕt have many medications and in the hospital 3 kids share a bed and 2 adults share a bed and there is lots of patients that would probably not even recieve treatment or others who just canÕt afford it. also the hospital doesnÕt even have a doctor they only have a clinical officer running the hospital. in the hospital they also didnÕt have running water and electricity. also itÕs bad how many people that have preventable diseases are near death when they shouldnÕt be. the most common disease is malaria and about 20,000 children die from it every day when it can be prevented but they donÕt have the medicine. my third reason is that most families that farm cant even keep their crops alive because they cannot afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. the families plant seeds time and again but they have a poor outcome because of the lack of fertilizer and water. each year the farmers worry if they have enough food to keep their family healthy. or will the children go hungry and become sick? now the people in kenya have water and electricity for the hospital children can go to school for free and people can get medicines to help themselves from sickness. also the farmers now have water and fertilizers to grow healthy crops to feed their family. those are the reasons why children in the u.s. should read about how kenya has changed with the help of the millennium villages project. children in the us should know that they should be happy and grateful that they have medicine, food, water, school to go to, and a hospital."	4	4		3																					
1293	1	"i think that like the author said winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime but, it is not an easy task to achieve. first, i think that if people actually help this project might actually work. for example, the author explains how when she first got to the village they went to bar sauri primary school to meet the people and there was people dancing and singing. which means that these people are always joyful when they are together, so people can actually help out and also have fun doing it. another example of this is that, people actually think they can accomplish this they just need to help out with this goal. for example in this essay it says that their goal is to get people out of poverty, assure them acess to health, and to stabilize their economy. they can reach this goal if they actually think they can do it and help out. last, i think that this goal might be achievable because villages are supposed to get things like fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. i think that if people actually help out the villages can get these supplies, which can help out with many things they need like farming, a hospital, and school."	4	3		1																					
1299	1	"i think it important so that before the project the people could see how keya was likem and how sad it was. for example before the project was build, kids had to walk around bare foot, their parents couldnÕt afford money for their kids treatment, and when children went to school they didnÕt have lunch, so they had to be hungry they whole school period. know that the milleninum project was built, children could go to school happy, and fill with enery, and not hungry, they could get their educations. people think that kenya is a good place now because of this project made up, know there is medchina for kids to help there treatment cure, people have new cloths to ware instead of walking bare food, and parents could work hard to earn money. so know the people who built the project, they hope that it will still until 2015-2025. i think that if this project wouldnÕt have been built people would be suffering their lives, dieing and get disease very easy. thanks to the project everything is going well in kenya."	5	6		1

1304	1	"from the article, i do believe that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó she persuaded me to want to help those who are facing poverty now; and who will have to face it in the future. the way she descubles the poor woman and children in paragraph #2 makes me want to cry, (even though i wonÕt cry, iÕll just feel extremly sad. also, in the first paragraph of the fight for better health, the hospital sounded rundown; and if you needed special medical attention, you would most likely die i would especially want to help fight against poverty because i would not want my children to have 7% of having the change of being homeless or facing poverty. so , i myself would encourage others to help the next generation in there family. hopefully they would contribute money that oculd go to all the contries that are struggling. but, everyone must try and help each other and follow the golden rule;Ó do unto others, as you would want them to do unto you,Ó therefore everything will be organized and progress even faster if everyone works toegther. unfortunated there are some selfish people who do nto care about other. those are the people that will slow progress in completing our goal. hannah was very brave to go to a 3rd world country. there is aobut a 50% chance of her getting a fatal disease in the counry, that she could die from but iÕm glad that did not stop her. and, it would most-certainly not discourage me either. i encourage everyone to help Òwin the fight poverty and achieve the ÒimpossibleÓ."	5	6		0																					
1305	1	"she did not convince me. she did not convince me because she gave a lot of examples that made it difficult to belive Òwinning against poverty is achievable. the line Ð Òpatients who probably would not receive treatment, either because the hospital could not have it or patients could not afford itÓ Ð this is really a big problem because if one hospital could not afford expensive suplies to treat their patients then thereÕs about one-hundred other hospitals that need expensive suplies too that will take a long time to fix. another reason why i donÕt belive this is acomplishable is that the text also says Ð Òthier crops were dying because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation.Ó she gives a lot of bad examples than good. she does not give good examples but she uses that word ÒimproveÓ not achivable. all this tells me is that they can improve; improving is good but will it really help? they will improve but may not achive. they will need to support a whole contry and to me it does not take 15 years to do it it takes like 30 or a century. (in this case) they also need help with school and many childrenÕs parents can not afford school fees. Òmany kids in the savri did not attend school because thier parents could not afford school fees.Ó Ð this seems nearly impossible because it will be really hard to help a whole contry on that. not mention the school needs help too with basic stuff like chairs, desks, water fountains and food so kids donÕt get exhausted. and the author speaks of a disease called malaria. Òkids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick.Ó this disease is treatable and preventable. a bed net can help with it for five years. this bed net costÕs 5 dollars. this is crazy because people donÕt even live on a dollar a day so help providing the bed net for a whole contry seems nearly impossible to me."	6	5		3																					
1308	1	"yes the fight against poverty is achieveable because in 2008 they started to get even better because the hospitals have medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping sight in sauri. the hunger crises has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. there are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the students. dramatic changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supporters of the milennium villages project. if they didnt get all this done by 2015. i would seriously help by letting the sauri people come to the united states and have food, water, let them get new clothes, let them take a good shower(with hot water), and just let them have a peaceful time. i care about the sauri people because maybe some of my family comes from there and if i new them i would send them water food and clothing because i hate just seeing people die or hearing about them die because alot of good and inocent people die and there familys get so sad. i would use all my might to help them. i wouldnt even care if i had to help them for the rest of my life because as i always say, ""everyone is this world is a family and no one can change that"". people in sauri need our help because they're dieing there getting sick and most of all they dont even have the basic needs. so everyone in the world help the sauri people because over 20,00 kids die in kenya because they get really sick so we need your help. buy medicine, get electricity, water, let them go to school free, get school supplies, let them have free food, get fertilizer for the plants, buy them new clothes, get more beds for the hospital and most of all help them stay alive so new borns, kids, and adults can have a longer life. make them help them be the 2 h's- healthy and happy. in 2004 they had alot of disease like malaria and everyday 20,00 kids would die because of malaria. they didnt have fertilizer, food or water. in hospitals there was no doctor, there was no water or electricity, and kids would have to share a bed in the hospital and so did adults. but, then in 2008 (4 years later), in sauri it was starting to become a good place. they had amazing progress. they started to give medicine for free for most common diseases, they have a generator for electricity, they have water for the people and plants, they have fertilizer, and in every village they had bed nets. so i think by 2015 sauri will be so wonderful and all the family's will be happy."	5	4		3																					
1310	1	"i think the author thinks its important for kids in the united states to learn about how life was like in kenya before and after the millennium villages project so we could try to help people out in life during their struggles. malaria was a common and serious disease in africa. kids can die easily and adults can get really sick. to prevent the mosquito to biting you when you are sleeping, you would have to use a bed net for $5. the bed net can save millions of lives but 20,000 kids die everyday. when people would go to the hospital because of malaria, there would be no doctors. malaria was preventaliv and treatable but there wasnÕt any medicine. there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. the room was filled with patients that probably canÕt get treatment. the next problem the city faced is that the crops were dying because they couldnÕt afford irrigation and fertilizer. the children couldnÕt attend school because they couldnÕt afford school fees. the kids that didnÕt go to school, had to do chores all day long. they had to go get some water and wood. the children didnÕt have any supplies. so they had to work with what they had. they didnÕt have a midday meal. so at the end of school they didnÕt have any energy to do anything. now things have gotten better. the hospital has medicine. bed nets are used for every sleeping site in sauri. the schools now serve lunch. the farmers now have fertilizer and seeds. they also have farming tools."	4	3		3

1316	1	"there are many ways we could fight the war of poverty. there is awareness, food, health and medicines, and school. the author really makes me believe we can end poverty. awareness is a big part if ending poverty. since it's pretty obvious they need help from other countries, (as said in the last paragraph). to do that, we need to let people know about the situation in sauri. food really would help people in sauri. many people are starving in sauri. many farmers can't grow crops because they don't have the correct fertilizer or irrigation system. many families of farmers are starving or sick. people have pitched in and bought fertilizer and seeds. the tools needed were also sent to the farmers. malaria is a common disease in sauri. it is preventable and treatable. a bed net with chemicals keeps out mosquitos carrying malaria while people sleep. people have sent bed nets to every sleeping site in sauri. hospitals are overcrowded with sick patients. there is no running water or electricity. there wasn't even a doctor. but now, there is medicine, free of charge, for almost every disease. there is running water, and a generator for electricity. attendance rate in schools are very low in sauri. children are sometimes needed i'd chides such as fetching water or wood. also there are some families that couldn't afford school fees. some schools even had a shortage on supplies. the children that were in school, didn't get a mid-day meal or lunch. their school work wasn't as well as it could've been. with some help, they got rid of school fees and received more supplies. now, the children get meals everyday. as you can see, with a little help and support from other countries, poverty can end. the millenium villages project has already bettered some major problem areas in sauri. it goes to show you that support can help even the most impoverished countries."	5	4		3																					
1317	1	"yes, because even though proverty is still going on now it does not mean that it can not be stop. hannah thinks that proverty will end by 2015 but you never know. the world is going to increase more stores and schools. but if everyone really tries to end proverty i believe it can be done. maybe starting with recycling and taking shorter showers, but no really short that you don't get clean. then maybe if we make more money or earn it we can donate it to any charity in the world. proverty is not on in africa, it's practiclly every where! even though africa got better it didn't end proverty. maybe they should make a law or something that says and declare that proverty needs to need. there's no specific date when it will end but it will. when it does i am going to be so proud, wheather i'm alive or not."	4	4		0

1326	1	"the author did convince me that, ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". in paragraph 3 lines 1+2 it stated that, the plan is get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. i paragraph the fight for better health on lines 1+2 it says that, it was not in good shape. then on line 2, there were three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. which they are saying that it was so full 2 or more people had to sleep one bed. in paragraph 9 lines 1+2 it says, the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of most common diseases. so they are saying that some of the medicine are free for people to buy, but not all of them are free. now in the last paragraph which is paragraph 10 lines 4 +6 it stated that, sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. so my answer is correct because, the author did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime""."	4	4		2																					
1329	1	"is winning the faith against poverty achievable in our life? is winning the faith against poverty achievable in our life? i think it could be done if everybody saw what a big deal it was and how important it is maybe how it could save thousands of lives. but not many people really care for other countries other than their own. other  people are afraid of being scamned of their money. there was a recent scam of hundreds of thousands of people from a person named russel. he made people believe a man named joseph kony was kidnapping children in uganda and turning them into children soldiers. many people felt sympathy and pity towards them and sent money to the foundation Òkony 2012.Ó i recently took a trip to vietnam. saigon, specifically. when i was there, i visited my grandmotherÕs house. she lives in the slums, where i saw many people selling hats, food, and drinks on the streets. many people need shelter and food. just a simple order at kfc can cost up to 200 dong, or 20 usd. there, i saw people selling bed nets for mosquitos, and electric swatters for wasps and bees. i then realized how lucky i was to be able to go to school and have clean air and water. i believe achieving faith could not be done because when i was in vietnam, i saw many people walk past homeless people and send them disgusted looks, rather than sympathy. they probably donÕt understand that it means a lot to them, and could save them from tuberculosis, a disease very commen in saigon. another reason why i donÕt think it is acheivable is because each countryÕs economy is progressivly getting worse and worse. in the us, i see lots of people on the streets everyday without a home or food to eat. people are losing their jobs and donÕt have enough money to pay for themselves, or their children. our country and africa are very similar in some ways, many people are in need of shelter and clean water to drink. so, is winning the faith against poverty achievable in our life? i think no, because the generation is getting greedier and the economy is going down as well. it would be achievable if more people saw how it could make a difference, but sadly, not everybody does."	4	3		0																					
1331	1	"my thought is that it is achievable. but it was a very hard challenge for them because they'd have to upgrade their medical production so that way sauri could be cured of their sicknesses, but in the article it seemed like it wasent that hard because they had fixed many harsh problems for the city of sauri, now their hospitals has more care and you get cured with no pay so that the poor can stay alive. also, children can go to school because there aren't any more school fees. i think it was very fast that they finished it in 4 years. now they have clean water to drink. now everyone has a bed net now so now bugs can't get them in their sleep and now they can stay healthy."	5	4		2																					
1332	1	"i believe that we can stop poverty for the millennium villages. in just 4 years, they have got hospitals medicines and it has a free of charge, and gets running water which generates the technology. bed nets are used in very sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizers and seeds, as well as tools needed to maintain food supplies. also the education of the villages have served lunch at school for students, there are no school fees, and attendence rates have gone up. what we have here in the u.s. we can give to the millennium people. compared to us they live on a dollar a day, but us we live lots more than that and life is easy for us but not for them. if we just keep on helping them we can accomplish the end of poverty."	5	4		1																					
1337	1	"yes, the author did convince me that the poverty is achievable because there are mosquitoes has a disease that is called malaria. the kids and adults get infected by the disease the mosquitoes has. the kids gets more sick then the adults so they made a hamlock with a medicine for the mosquitoes. it school, kids doesnÕt have paper, pencil, and text books. and everyone was poor with no money that the costs cost 5 dollars each. most humans die when they get the malaria from the disease mosquitoes. the mosquitoes carry the malaria to infect humans."	4	4		1																					
1342	1	"i think that it is achievable to take people out of poverty all over the world, even though it would be very hard. to get it achievable, you would first need hospitals, school supplies, water, electricity, and etc. the hospitals in places like africa is very poor. example: ""the rooms were packed with patients would probably would not recieve treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or cannot afford it. the hospital don't have a doctor, only a clinical officer who runs it."" the milliennium villages project helped by ""giving the patients medicine free of charge for the common dieseases. they also have a generator which gives them electricity in the hospital and fresh water. the project achieved that in 2008 (4 years) so i believe that they could achieve the same thing in other poor places. they helped stops malaria, a common disease in africa. in 2004, ""people in africa cannot prevent malria because they cannot afford treatment and bed nets to keep it away. each bed net cost $5, but 20,000 kids die every day from it."" in 2008, ""everyone in sauri have a bed net."" ""the crops are dying in sauri because they don't have water and fertilizer to help it grow."" it is harsh in sauri and other places because every years, the farmers will plants seeds and they always die. the millennium village project helped the farmers by giving them water and fertilizer to help their crops grow. most kids in sauri have no knowledge because they cannot go to school. ""the school have very little supplies and they have no midday meal."" now, every kid in sauri can go to school with supplies and eat lunch there. that is why i think that getting people out o poverty is achievable."	4	4		3																					
1344	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? the two sides of the argument are people who feel that we can win the fight against within our lifetime and people who donÕt. this issue is important because half of the people in the world live in poverty. i am with the people who feel that winning the fight against poverty is not achievable in our lifetime. first of all, winning the fight against poverty within my lifetime isnÕt possible because poverty has been a big issue for a very long time. people living in poverty has been happening way before i was born. therefore, it has been happening for more than the lifetime of any person still living. we canÕt just do this in less than about 100 years. some people may say that because sauri has made amazing progress in four years, that we can win the fight against poverty. however, sauri is just a small village with a small population, so their argument is invalid. second of all, we donÕt have enough money to help everyone living in poverty. many people have just the right amount of money to live off of. if those people help the people living in poverty, they will be living in poverty, too. the opposing side may say that we will have enough money if the rich people will just chip in. i donÕt agree because many wealthier people already give a lot of their money and time to help poorer people. third of all, i donÕt think that winning the fight against poverty within our lifetime is possible because there are too many people that need help. about 50% of the world population lives on less than $2.50 a day. with that many people, it is really hard to meet these goals by 2015 or 2025. others may say that since dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa, it is possible for poverty to be a thing of the past. i disagree because that is only the villages of a part of africa. there are still more poverty-stricken areas in africa and around the world. some people may say that if every single person on earth helps in some way, we can win the fight against poverty. i disagree with this point of view because there are people who overtime just to make enough money for their families. also, almost every single person in some way have already helped people in poverty. yet, we arenÕt that close to winning the fight against poverty. in conclusion, i donÕt think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because poverty has been happening for a very long time, we donÕt have the money, and there are too many people living in poverty. even though i think that we canÕt win the fight against poverty in our lifetime, i still think that we should still help people in poverty."	4	4		1

""the yala sub-district has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases."" wrote hannah. i beleive if we can go from ""rooms packed with patients who would probably not receive treatment,"" to ""medicine free of charge, for all of the most common diseases."" i think we have a shot at this."	5	4		2

1419	1	"in my opinion, i believe ""winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime"" is a achievable plan because if the whole world help donating money or something else to the poverty, we can achieve the goal. just like what the author said that ""they people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years"" in the four years, there are alot places changed more richer than than 2004. in my live, i still have alot times to accomplish the goal. if everyone on the world donate some money, they will help alot poor families such as letting kids to have more education, buying bed nets, fertilizer, and more foods to them. if their donation continues, alot families will out of poverty. some people may think that they have a hard time on donating that much money, but they can just donate some clothes that they don't need to the poor people. everything peope donate will help a lot of poor people. if the world continues like this, we will win the fight. then the world will become a better world."	5	5		0																					
1422	1	based on the article did the author convince you that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime.  yes the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable.  i think it is acheivable because they have all of the things they need.  the fixed the hospital and and put water in there a generator.  they also have everything like medicine and everything is fine.  that is why i think they can acheive and succeed on there goal.	3	5		1																					
1430	1	"the author convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"", because a lots of people going to die if we don't fight against poverty. if there are no water and fertilizer, the crops going to die, and people wouldn't have enough food to eat. people are going to be hungry and they can't work any more or they will get sick. hospitals didn't even have water, medicine, and food. people have to share their bed with the others. water is not connected to hospital. maybe people going to die with no medicine and water. there were no nets at the hospitals. pecople can die from having no nets on their bed, because mosquitoes can bit them easily. children want to go to school, but their parents can't afford the payment of school. they have to stay home to work, so they can't get money or food. parents have to pay for school supplies, lunch and the payment for their children to go to school. so, we have to fight for better health people should provid supplies and lunch for school, running water, electricity, and medicine for hospitals, and nets for beds."	4	4		1																					
1436	1	this story has made me believe that we can abolish poverty. this is because she has shown me how bad life can be. she has also made me want to help. also think about this story it probably made you want to help. she has made many people want to join. think about it would you want to be treated like they do in africa for mosqituo bite? no so it makes you feel bad. also it shows how bad the hospitals are and i would hate to be treated there. and come on i know that you may hate school but the truth is school is for you own good! my  most important reason is hope. hope helps you think there's a chance. look at the hospitals in a four year difference. sure it's not perfect but now it has water and electricity. now the kids are getting educated. now bed nets are available and are saving money lives. don't you see the dream to abolish all poverty can be possible!	4	4		1																					
1438	1	"based on the article i think that the author did a very good job of persauding me to believe that poverty is something that we can fight. she sharet her tough experience, gave us solutions, and why we should take part in it the author really showed us that conditions we are trying to fix. she mentions how in the hospital there isn't enough space, so people have to share beds. also she showed how hard it was for them to eat, because of their poor farming. the author said that even having to look at the conditions made her feel sad, sick, and scared. she said that there were things we could do to help stop this. for example, children are dying because of malaria, even though the medicine doesn't cost much and its curable. and if they could only afford bed nets, which are only $5, it could have saved many lives. so there are many solutions and things we can do to help, but there aren't that many people helping. in the last paragraph, the author says something that really held alot of importance and grabbed my attention. she states that she wants poverty to be a thing of history when she has children. in that sentence alone, it states one very important reason to why we should help stop poverty and world hunger. for the future of our children and the world! so far the work they have done has really paid off. hospitals are better, children are in school, and hunger is soon to be gone. this movement is reallly an accomplishment in africa today. so imagine what more we can do if we all help!"	4	5		2																					
1439	1	"this is a very hard topic to decide on. some people may say that we can't win the fight against poverty in our lifetime while others haven't gave up and are still fighting. personaly, i think that we can win the fight against poverty. i know it make take a lot of time, but with enough help, support, and faith, anything is possible. i feel that one of the main reasons why we haven't defeted poverty is because people don't belive that we can. they think that it is the way that things are supposed to be and they also may think ""what could one person do to change the world"". if everyone thinks this then we will get no where, but if everyone contributes and helps out, people wouldn't be in poverty and the whold would be different. thousands of children are dying each day because of poverty. their families barley have enough money to survive, and maybe not even enough. these 20,000 children are dying each day because of malaria. a disease that mesquitos have that can't be stoped. these children that are dying don't even have controll over the situation. just think about it, by contributing five dollars to these organizations. you are buying a misquitoe net to save their lives. i think of it as a way to buy their lives, with a price tage of only five dollars. overall, i feel that this organization is great and saves millions of lives every year. i feel that it is very thoughtful and genorouse to help out strangers in such a significant way. this organization is helping to spare childrens lives and i feel it should be well know. ordinary people, even you, can help put a stop to this."	5	5		1																					
1447	1	thay can win if thay have more tools because in the text it says that thay need nets to sevive. and thay need water and air conditioning and other to servive. and thay can mite win the fight and get more money because the poor donÕt get a dollar like 1 day or no money at all and thay is why people is dieing because the net cost five dollars and that keep them alive so if thay donÕt have the net thay will die.	6	6		0

1483	1	"the united nation program can be able to end poverty. the moment they arrived at kenya, they started fixing things. before the program, you cannot exactly say that the sauris agriculture flourished. because of the tiny supply of tools, fertilizer, and other materials the farmers had their crops werenÕt nicely grown. then united nations came along, and supported the farmers by giving them the things they needed-gardening tools, fertilizer, and seeds. over time, with those tools, the farmers were able to grow better crops and feed their families. health wasnÕt guaranteed either. the people living in sauri could easily get sick any time, any day. when they fell sick, they could be moved to the hospital, but that didnÕt really give them that many benefits-the hospitals were crowded and understocked. there would be two adults or three kids shoved together onto a single hospital bed. medication and doctors werenÕt provided, either. there was no doctor, just a clinical officer that managed the entire thing. the patients rarely got better. some of them couldnÕt get the medication they need either because the hospital couldnÕt provide it or because the patientÕs family simply couldnÕt afford it. the program helped stock the hospitals with electricity, water, and medicine the patients and the entire hospital needed. to prevent more sickness, they also provided bed nets that would ward off miquitos with malaria, preventing more sickness. education also went higher. before, most students couldnÕt go to school because their families needed them to help around the house, occupying all their time. school supplies were very limited, and the kids had to try and work with what they have. the people there donÕt have lunch, so by the end of the day, the kids had no energy whatsoever. those who could afford to go to school were considered very lucky. the program donated a lot of school supplies and helped make lunch available to the schools. kids started going to school, and education was free of charge. with everything the united nation did in just four years, sauri was improving dramatically. if they keep going, the entire country of kenya will think of poverty as history."	3	3		3

1566	1	well to me i dont really think the author convinced the readers. i dont think he convinced the readers because he was just giving out facts about what happened and the process. but again she did give alot out about how people felt about it. they felt sorta scared and sad about what changes were going to happen. some changes that were going to occur were good and bad but it was for the safety and best. i would also say the author did sort of try to convince the readers because she did try to help in one way. she did her best to help and stuff but she didnt really convince. she told us the changes with the medicine and fertilizing they werw changing all but because they need to. not alot of people wanted to but they had no choice. one of the changes were fertilizing. what they were going to do with fertilizing was towards the farm. they were going to fertilize crop the plants. they only were planning that for better food because its going rotten. they didnt want everyone to go sick because they really didnt have good medical. they also fixed the medical. what they did was have people join the education to learn. they learn then show others for the job. their job was working as doctors to help cure people who are sick. if they dont have medical people would live in good surrounding but die and get sick. its good they make medical so people can get healthy.	4	4		1																					
1571	1	"yes i think winning the fight was great because if no kids are geting help then they are going to die and i think that is wrong because if you already had 20,000 kids that die then you dont what to have no more kids that are going to die so i really think that him winning now kids are geting better and still liveing and they are going to get more and more help in the hospital."	3	4		0																					
1577	1	"the author did convince me that the fight against poverty is achievable in my lifetime. she convinced me because of all the progress sauri, kenya has made in four years. also, she is very optimistic about all the goals the millennium villages project is trying to meet. one reason the author has convinced me is because of how the hospital has improved in just four years. in 2004, there was no running water, no electricity, and three children to a bed and two adults to a bed. also, many of the patients would die because the medication they needed was not available or they couldnÕt afford it. in 2008 there now is running water, electricity, and medicine is free of charge, so even if a patient canÕt afford that medicine they can still get help. that goal was reached in just four years. also, now many children attend school. in 2004 there were limited supplies and fees for schools. the fees caused many children not to come to school because their parents couldnÕt afford it. also, there was no lunch so kids couldnÕt concentrate on their school work. with the help from the millennium villages project in 2008 schools got all the supplies they needed, there is no fee anymore, and lunch is now served. now many kids go to school. another goal was reached in four years. another reason iÕm convinced is because people arenÕt starving. the millennium villags project provided fertilizer so that villagers could grow food for there families. in 2004 people were starving because of lack of fertilizer and water. the author again shows that the goal can be reached in our lifetime. finally, malaria is now being is prevented. before people got malaria because there were no bed nets. now bednets are provided to prevent malaria. this goal was reached in a short amount of time. in conclusion i feel that the author truly convinced me that the goal of no poverty can be reached in my lifetime. as you can see all of the changes made in just four years has changed sauri, kenya so much. thing as simple as bednets can help. through all the examples of how sauri, kenya has changed in just four years the fight against poverty can be won in my lifetime of everyone works together. the author has convinced me."	4	4		3																					
1580	1	"winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. itÕs takes very long to make a achievment. it took them 4 years. in kenya, sauri there was alot of people that have poverty. people were poor. people lived with $1 or less a day. our goal is to get people out of poverty. they need fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. people had lots of diseases. the most common disease is called malaria. to prevent not having malaria, you get a bed net. not everyone had it because the could not afford it. people did not have alot of food because there is no crops. for schools, they need more supplies. to make this better, we can serve free lunches to the school, getting a bed net in every bed, have enough medicine, and providing ferlilizers and seeds. letÕs try to fight against poverty!"	4	4		2																					
1590	1	"yes, the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty in our lifetime. the reason i say this is because the authors gave us examples and it may seem impossible but if you donÕt give up and is determined like the author you could achieve the goal and also if you set your mind to it. examples in 2004, in the yala sub-district there were no water, no medicine and no electricity but in 2008 there were water, medicine, and electricity. in 2004 many kenyans were dying from malaria because they couldnÕt afford bed nets because it was too expensive, but in 2008 every bedsite in sauri has a bed net. in 2004 there werenÕt that much food, but in 2008 the hunger crisis had been addressed with fertilizers and seed, as well as tool to maintain the food supply. in 2004 there were no lunches and when kids left school in sauri they didnÕt have any energy, but by 2008 there were no school fees and the school now serves lunches. also the attendant rate is way up. dramatic changes has occurred in 80 villages across sub-saharan africa. you see the project has a goal to finish by 2015 and they started in 2004. and by 2008 Òonly 4 years since the project startedÓ they are halfway done. 2015 is only 7 years apart from 2015. 2015-2008 7. in another 4 years i predict or even in 3 years they would complete the project. i say this because of all the examples and details i have. given sauri is already reaching the goals they had wanted to complete."	6	5		3																					
1595	1	"i do believe that the fight against proverty can happen in my lifetime. if 1 girl did it in 4 years. it can happen all over the world. in sauri before the girl helped them out they had no healthcare now, they donÕt ever have to pay for medicine. their economy is very bad the sauriÕs economy is improving. the people may say shes magical its only hard work. the schools there you have to pay for. now, they are free. what im trying to say is if 1 girl can do it the world can. all we need is hard work to do the job right."	4	4		1																					
1597	1	"yes, because people had no water or electricity and when they were sick they had no money to go to the hospital or there were no doctors at the hospital, only a clinical doctor. malaria, which was carried by mosquitoes, caused children to die and adults to get sick. a solution that saves lives of people from dying was to get a net bed. the farmer's crops were dying because they couldn't find fertilizer that was necessary for their crops. many schools had very little supplies like books, paper and pencils which made it hard for the students to concentrate. kids didn't have any energy by the end of the day, as there was no midday meal. as the people of sauri have been making progress over the past four years, bed nets are used in every sleeping site, there are no school fees and the attendance rate is up."	6	5		1																					
1601	1	i am convinced that it will be achievevable because they been helping other people for many years and they try everything they can to help them.  they tried to help the kids with the hospital from getting diseases like malaria. kidÕs parents could not afford to go to school did not have supplies and did not have lunch so they did not have energy at the end of the day.  they still have two and a half more year until the project expires so they try their best to help them as much as they can. i am also convinced that it will be achievable because people there cannot afford anything and they make less than one dollar every day so other people will try to make it a better future for them.  people do not want them to suffer from diseases so they built a hospital with better things to help them survive.  they also put more school supplies to help them learn. many people feel scared and sad to see them hurt and see them have diseases.  thatÕs why many people are helping them from the project to help them survive.  they have been doing it for many years and they will keep helping them until the project expires.  they will happen no matter what and help everyone in sauri.  alot of them canÕt afford a lot of things but many people still help them.	4	4		2																					
1603	1	"the author did convince me that we can win against poverty because in 2004-2008 sauri had improved greatly. for example the yala sub-district hospital now has medicine. it is now free of charge for most of all common diseases. water is now connected to the hospital which now has a generator for electricity. also there are no more school fees, and the schools now serves lunches for the students. this is why i think the author convince me because now the school and the hospital and the kids are now making good progress."	4	4		1																					
1607	1	"the author convinced me that poverty is going to end in our lifetime because of what happened to sauri, kenya in 4 years. the millennium villages project can end poverty in our lifetime because they provide a electrical generator for the hospital. so they can use electricity to record data. they made it possible that water can be at the hospital too. hospitals need water because to treat wounds, and keeping patients hydrated. the project also provided tools, fertilizer, and seeds for the farmers. the farmers needed more to grow more crops for their own family, or to sell and make money. fertillizer to make the crops grow better and be able to eat, not throwing it away. farmers needed tools for build their houses and to farm the fields. the most common disease in sauri, kenya is malaria, which is costed by mosquitos biting people, when they are sleeping. bug nets can prevent this disease, but most people couldnÕt afford it. the united nationÕs organization provided them w/ bug nets. the hospital now has medicine for most diseases and itÕs free of charge. this project also helped kids in sauri by giving them materials for education like pencils, notebooks, and books. the project also provided lunch during school, so the kids have enough energy for the rest of the day. now, the schools are free in 80 different villages across sub-saharan africa. poverty can be won during our lifetime because if poverty can end in sauri in 4 years, it can happen to all villages/countries during our lifetim."	5	4		1																					
1610	1	"yes, i believe this is possible winning this figh against poverty is achivable in our life. she convinse me because giving examples of people in villages of sauri. it affected them by money, proverty and ressources. people in sauri suffered alot. they were suffering with different problems. she also said how people were in the hospital suffering and how they couldnÕt afford it. their was also people hear death that didnÕt need to be there. she also explained how the project they were doing was goin to stop all their problems. she said how the project was goin to run by helping people in sauri and have a better future. these people dont need to be here in a village with all these diseases and in danger of death. she explained how they didnt have electricity and had no water running. some people couldnt afford all of the medicine. their was not alot of rooms so every patient could be in. they had at leas six people in a room. also something that convince me was that they had the project running in 2008 and it was a good prosedure. they went well in the project. she explained how succesful this project is and how they had water running, electricity running too. they had medicine too. they had all of this in 80 villages it wasc a great project procedure."	5	6		1																					
1612	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. we can stop poverty by teaching the people how to garden giving them better things that work. we can use bug spray to keep the mosquitoes that have malaria away. we can teach teachers over there more to teach the kids we can donate clothes old doors clean them before giving them away. give them new stuff tv's computers plug ins for the computers and tv's. give them tools like drills and screw drivers chain saws, saws, hoses, light bullbs. computers help them search for things. we can also give them new foods like mc.donalds, or vetgatarian foods salads carrot. help then construct buildings that they  need. they need more learning props they need food they need more clothes new clothes they need to have a life like us a great life the also need peace."	4	4		0																					
1617	1	"yes, i think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life timeÓ because in the story, they have won the fight against poverty. it took a while, but they still did it. it said that it took four years for the progress. -the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of fthe most common diseases, and water is connected to the hospital, and also electricity. -bed nets are used in every sleeping sites in sauri. -the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizers and seeds, as well as he tools needed to maintain the food supply. -there are no school fees, and they serve lunches for students."	4	4		2																					
1620	1	i think they are gonna achieve it because they have better medicine after 2008 and they have better rates to help the disease. they also even have a better elecristy generator. they even have a better water and medicine supply they have stopped most of the hunger.	3	4		1																					
1627	1	"i belive that it is possible /achievable to win the war against poverty . i t tells you in the artical that the people of sauii need Ðclothes, food, and medicines . those items are very easy to obtaian in some coutries like ours. i t wouls be very easy for someone to donate there  time for a good cause. another example is that schools cost money this means that children have to pay for education.if in four years they fgot free education more clothes and unharmed food that alot more can be done in the next 9 years wity a little bit of help. this reminds me of a time when people in d.c were living on park benches and stuff but some person cared enough to show them some love and help them out so i f it can be done for them why canÕt it be done for the people of sauii. finally  there are chldren dieing form something as little as mosqutio bites, so i f you can help why donÕt thave  have improved so much i belive that with a little more help and work this city/town can be up to date by 2015."	4	4		1																					
1632	1	"the author hannah sachs did convince me that winning against poverty in our lifetime is possible. in the text it says that all over sauri, kenya people are using bed nets to protect them from malaria. in the text it also says that in schools they get midday meals everyday and that the attendance us getting higher. it also says that the hospital is free and there is medicine, running water, and electricity. this shows that we can win the fight against poverty because they went from no beds nets to all from no electrity and water to having medicine running water and electrity, and from having low attendance to having high attendence and a midday meal if one villiage can do this then all the villages can do it all over africa."	4	4		2																					
1644	1	"i think the fight against proverty is possible. i think itÕs possible because they did it in just four years they had well for one reason they have free of charge. of all common disease. second, they have water leading to the hospital and a generator for eletricity. thrid, now every sleeping site in sauri has a bed nets so they donÕt get diseases and keeps the bugs away. fourth, now they have seeds, and fertilizer. they also have tools to maintain the food supply. fifth, they now no longer charge school fees, they also serve meals everyday, and the schools attendence rate is higher."	4	4		1																					
1645	1	"yes, i think the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifeime"". i think this because the author, hannah sachs, tells us easy things we can do to help stop poverty. here are three things the author metins in the text. one thing we (everybody in the world) can do is give donations. the people in sauri, kenya live off of one dollar a day. and, that only covers food. what about water, shelter, and clothing? their clothes are tattered. by donating five dollars you can help the people with their poverty. this is one thing the author mentions. another thing we can do is help their schools. many kid in sauri do not attend school. this is because of high school fees. like i previously stated the people in sauri live off of one dollar a day. that one dollar is for food. how are they supposed to pay the fees? also, it is hard to focus. the school children don't get lunch. some people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, well lunch is pretty important too. lunch helps you push through the rest of the day. this is a second hing the author mentions. finally, the autho tells us about the health care in sauri, kenya. in the hospital there was three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed. that is not very healthy! what if one of those adults or kids had a contagious disease? then, everybody gets it. there was no doctor! only a clinical officer that ran the hospital. also, there was no running water or power. running water cleans you and hydrates you. there was no power; so how does the hospital take x-rays? these are all things the author mentions to convience me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime""."	6	5		2																					
1646	1	i think that we can win the fight between poverty because weth all this techology we can do anything we want antiotics and anything.	4	4		0																					
1649	1	"i think the author did give us convincing detail that ""winning the fight to end poverty"" is achevable because if you go back to a better life 2008 you see a 16 year old can change the lives of people is just amazing for example she made it possible for the kids to each lunch or go to school for free and also fix a hospital and get them all bed net and gave them running water and electricy so i belive if she can do it from when she was 12 all the way till she was 16 i think any one can do it. also i like her trying to be a hero and try to help people in poverty and people dying is just the best a person can do at that age and so i think the world can do it."	4	5		1																					
1651	1	yes because like the little girl sad she don't want to see poeple and i don't want to see anybody sick either. they started to make all of the common diceses free at the hospitial. there are no school fee's anymore the schools now serves lunch for the students. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crists had been addressed with fertilizer and seeds as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villiges across sub-saharan africa. the progress is encouraging to supportes.	5	4		1																					
1655	1	hanna sachs aprove the winning the fight against of poverty in 2004 2 they have no food for the school and school was not free.  some kid had to help there mom and dad.  in 2008 they had food for lunch.  the scool was free and they have light in 2008.  i 2004 they had no doctor and they have to pay for the medicine.  they dount have no calen wather and no light.  in 2008 they had doctor and they get free medicine.  they had light and clane wather.  in 2004 they had dying crops.  because they could not afford it and the necessary fertilizer and irrigation.  in 2008 the hunger crisis has been addressed with the fertilizer and seeds wall as the tools was needed to maintain for the food supply.  in 2004 they had one disease and many kids daly evey day.  and they had bed nets but it caus $5 to but the bed nets but they olne had 1 doller ecah day and dne some people had bed nets.  in 2008 they had bed nets in every bed.  every one sleeping site in sauri.	4	4		2																					
1666	1	yes i do think its achivable because she said Òthe hunger crisis has been with fertile seeds water and everything. and she said that the people have made proggres in just 4 years. she said that all of the sleeping sights have bednets. she said that the schools alve lunch and no more fees she said that dramatic changes have been occured in 80 viallages.	5	4		1																					
1667	1	"i believe that it is definitely possible if everyone helps and rich people give a lot of money and stuff. but if they donÕt, it probably wonÕt happen in this lifetime, because there are only a few people who care. it look four years just to improve me village. also, the millennium village project may not be able to get enough money to supply running water and fertilizer and school supplies in all of kenya. also, they can still have bad luck. one year, after the millennium village projects are gone, crops might fail, or thereÕll be a new disease. then people could slip back into poverty. but if the whole world focuses on kenya, and people donate lots of money, it will be easy to obliterate poverty in kenya. it canÕt be that hard, because kenyaÕs not that big of a country. so, it depends. the author convinced me we can get rid of poverty in kenya if the whole world pitches in, but we canÕt if it doesnÕt."	5	5		1																					
1670	1	"yes, i think poverty would stop over the years. the process had moved along quickly and is having a good start. this would prove a lot over the years since in 4 years, a lot of things already have changed. it also saved lots of people, so this project is an success. the things that helped improve this area was cleaner water, more food, school, and bed nets. it shows in the text on a paragraph in a better life, how the people of sauri have made amazing progress over these four years in the first line. food was also an improvment as well in the project. the farmers had more water and fertilizer to grow crops to feed their families. they also had more seeds and the tools needed to maintain their supply of food. Òthe hunger crisis has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds in the a better life paragraph. the hospital was another improvement in project. water is also now connected to the hospital. there is also an generator for electricity. there are also more medicine to cure the common diease that are free of charge. Òhospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diease.Ó Òwater is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity.Ó this was found on the 2nd and 3rd sentence in Òa better lifeÓ paragraph. another improvement were the schools. studeents no longer had to pay an fee just to go to school. mid-day meal/lunch has also now been provided for students. Òthey now serve lunch to the students.Ó from Òa better lifeÓ paragraph. there are also more school supplys for the students to use and the attendance rate went up. Òthere are no school fees and the school now serves lunch to the students.Ó Òthe attendance rate is way up.Ó from Òa better lifeÓ paragraph. so all together in conclusion, poverty will be gone very soon. the progress shows that the fight of poverty is a chievable in our lifetime.

1674	1	"in my opinion, hannah sachs, who wrote Òa brighter futureÓ has conviced me that it is possible to end poverty in africa. before reading the artical, i thought that poverty in kenya was a thing that would last forever. while reading the artical, however, i put more thought into it. i realized that it was easier than i thought it was. before reading the artical i did not believe that we could end poverty in kenya. they have resources such as gold yet the money is not used to improve the lives of their citizens. according to several articals i read online, africaÕs government is unstable, resulting in poverty. it also seems that they lack a reliable source of water, which is nessesary for life. i also found it hopeless, because people die from dieseases that are easily preventable, but after reading the artical, i changed my mind. after reading the artical, i realized that i was overthinking. in my brain, i was telling myself that it would take billions of dollars to prevent malaria. apparantly, as the artical stated, five dollar bed nets treated with chemicals are capable of saving the twenty-thousand kids that died of malaria."	4	4		2

1728	1	"i think the fight against poverty is possible, because in the begining sauri had almost nothing, but later they had food, water, medicine, education, bed nets, and more money. sauri has a lot more now then it did before. all of this come from the help of the millennium villages project. back in 2004 sauri had little money. they could only make up to $1.00 a day. also they had little food. their crops were poor because they didn't have the money that they needed to buy fertilizer to make their plants grow strong. also they had little or no education. some kiss had to work around the house and kids who did to to school had no lunch or midday meal. in hospitals there were three children to a bed, or two adults to a bed. there was no running water or electricity. also there was only a clinical officer. that time was hard. by 2008 things had changes people could get medicine free of charge. people had food because they were given fertilizers and gardening tools. they had a better education because there were no school fees, and a midday meal. hospitals had more beds, water, and electricity. bed nets were in every sweeping area too. things has now improved. in sauri things had changed dramatically from 2004 to 2008, but their is still more to do. people are still i'm poverty, but if we work together we can help."	4	5		3

1733	1	"do you ever wonder how we can stop poverty for good? i do, and a Òbrighter futureÓ convinces me that we can change the lives of these impoverished people in just a single lifetime here are the reasons why. the author believes that the millenium villages project, the project designed to stop poverty in sauri, kenya, has made amazing progress in just four years. so, think about what they can do in a lifetime! one of these changes are the hospitals. there is now a hospital in the yala sub-district that has free medicine for the most common diseases like malaria. along with medicine, this amazing hospital has running water and even a generator for electricity. another important change is also related to malaria. in every single sauri sleeping site, there are bednets, blankets that are chemically treated to keep malarial mosquitos away for five years. to me, this is a great improvement because it has kept twenty thousand kids from dying an unneccessary death each and everyday. the next change is the change to the hunger crisis. Òthe hunger crisis has been solved with fertilizer and seedsÓ, along with the tools needed to help maintain the crops. this is an incredible improvement to when just 4 years ago, there was worried parents that didnÕt know whether or not they could feed their own children. the last change is to education. which i think is extremely important. where there were school fees, there are none in addition to that, the schools now serve a midday meal or lunch. that being said, the attendence rates are on the rise. in conclusion, i do believe that together we can end poverty for good, right here in this lifetime."	4	4		3

1747	1	"the fight aganist poverty is acheviable for many reasons. in sauri, kenya many people cannot afford school and healthcare. yet alone many people cannot get a decent amount of food. goals are set for 2015. most likely, the fight agnist poverty will be won by 2025. this will take alot of work and effort, but can be acheived. in sauri food and healthcare is limited, also like school supplies. sauri must find away to get more money for the people. this will get supplies for schools and beating disease. the only reason for this is to get more jobs. jobs will pay the people and help the economy. if alot of money is gained there will be more supplies to prevent disease. also more jobs will increase food for poor families, and raise money to build more hospitals. education is very difficult to get. more money will get more supplies for school. hopefully more kids will get educated. education will help kids get jobs. education is key for a strong economy. also education will get kids out of poverty. water is key for food. i believe sauri can get enough water for crops. soon enough, there will be enough food for families to depend on. unlike in the u.s., sauri's citizens will not take food for granted. they wont waste food which means they wont need as much. like i said, this will take a while. water is becoming scarce so it will take until 2025. in conclusion, acheiving the fight against poverty will take a lot of work but can be done. with a limited amount of water they can make decent amount of crops which will lead to food. jobs will help pay for healthcare and create more hospitals and help prevent diseases. all in all, we can win the fight aganist poverty."	4	4		1

The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything.

I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, Òsomewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
6003	3	"The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old menÕs help, and doesnÕt seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next ÒtownÓ he hits doesnÕt have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasnÕt further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief."	3	3		3

Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6023	3	"The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like Òbattery acid,Ó his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most."	2	2		2

The quote Òold timers who havenÕt left the confines of their porches since Carter was in officeÓ helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who donÕt go anywhere is a bad idea.

Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things.

The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think ÒI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. ÒGary and WilberÕs Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  "	3	3		3

When he arrives in the first ÒtownÓ that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist Òchuckled and moved onÓ, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached Òthe fork of sortsÓ twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and WilberÕs fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old menÕs directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																					
6417	3	"In the essay intitled ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limitÓ the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist.

At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a ÒA Rough Road AheadÓ sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die.

When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, Òwith strong legs and a smile on my faceÓ. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older menÕs travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldnÕt help but laugh. ÒIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. ÒAt this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map."	3	3		3

I chuckledÉÓ This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When Òa tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic.

The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. ÒThat probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen.

Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and Òcrippling hills,Ó according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted.

6541	3	"The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says ÒÉand the growing realization that I could drop from heatstrokeÉÓ @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ÒÉride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, IÕd be fine.Ó Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.

First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you"	3	2		3																					
6648	3	"Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isnÕt very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, Òone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnÕt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troublingÓ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that heÕs getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the Òsight was troublingÓ which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have."	2	2		2																					
6661	3	"In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,ÒThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.Ó In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, ÒIÕd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck IÕd hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.Ó This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldnÕt care if he died. From the authorÕs tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6667	3	"Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees.

6669	3	"In the story ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically."	3	0		3

""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.Ó This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesnÕt think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
6676	3	"In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, ÒThis sight was troubling,Ó he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, ÒIt didnÕt really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.Ó This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die."	2	2		2																					
6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
6692	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he canÕt go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop heÕs relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didnÕt really know where he was going because there wasnÕt a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first ÒtownÓ as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and heÕs only 12 he knows that heÕs not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6694	3	"The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, heÕs looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, heÕs becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that thereÕs no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved."	3	3		3

The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town.

As the cyclist is traveling along ÒThe high deserts of California in JuneÓ, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small Ògost townsÓ rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as ÒShort rolling hillsÓ through ghost the terrain and ever a snake.

6712	3	"In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness."	3	3		3

ÒThis shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2.

Also in the text, when, Òover one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,Ó hope was replenished into the cyclist.

The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welchÕs Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, ÒIt was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.Ó @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a Òfish camp,Ó with a modern bathroom and working sinks.

Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June.

He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged.

If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A Òghost townÓ with no good water could have killed him.

First, in the beginning of the story it says that, ÒThe sun was beginning to beat downÓ, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, ÒI was travelling through the high deserts of California in JuneÓ, CaliforniaÕs temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left.

However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasnÕt so hot, then he wouldnÕt of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didnÕt help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist."	2	3		3

Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasnÕt what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story."	1	1		1

As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a WelchÕs Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch.

The water was barely even water, so he didnÕt have much to drink until the next town. ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling  hillsÓ (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills ÒA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seenÓ (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him.

Also it refers to the road as Òrolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narratorÕs hope of getting there quickly.

The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip.

If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If itÕs all down hill, itÕs really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy.

ÒNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, Òtrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.Ó He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2

The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldnÕt have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. ItÕs easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva.

Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead.

The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion.

First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, ÒThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sipsÓ and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke."	2	2		2

This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because heÕs pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water.

His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isnÕt good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic canÕt help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, theyÕre landscape is mostly all hot sand.

Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road.

Ò[The] sight was troubling,Ó(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. ÒI hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed.

When he started that ride, he was confident that the Òold timersÓ were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he saysÓ The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.Ó He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was Òtrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ÒWith what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, Ògathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouthÓ just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon Ò Gary and wilberÕs fish camp best betÓ then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3	3		3																					
7507	3	"The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about Òtwo hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.Ó If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat."	1	1		1

DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM"	1	2		2																					
7515	3	"The cyclist ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When youÕre doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said ÒIn an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a WelchÕs grape juice factory and bottling plant.Ó He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying ÒIÕm going to die.Ó - and physically by becoming dehydrated."	2	2		2																					
7521	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, Òno one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,Ó he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to Òshort, rolling hillsÓ. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed ÒcripplingÓ, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience."	2	3		3																					
7529	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1		1																					
7533	3	"Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, ÒNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changingÒ (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey."	1	2		2																					
7536	3	"In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didnÕt know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about Òthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.Ó This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying."	1	1		1																					
7538	3	"When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. ÒThere was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.Ó The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says ÒI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnÕt a mirage, and tried not to get excited.Ó He was very doubtful heÕd get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  "	2	2		2																					
7541	3	"The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks itÕs only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there wouldÕve been no one there to help."	2	2		2																					
7542	3	"The features of the setting of ÒDo not exceed posted speed limitÓ greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says Òtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.Ó The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the WelchÕs Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned."	3	2		3																					
7545	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says Òand the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadnÕt been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3		3																					
7549	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1		1																					
7552	3	"In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and mear death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his distination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people."	1	1		1																					
7555	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
7556	3	"In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasnÕt up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction."	2	2		2																					
7568	3	"The setting of ÒRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed LimitÓ effects the cyclist in many was. The words Òhigh deserts of California in June,Ó from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you donÕt have water you donÕt have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said ÒRough Road Ahead.Ó There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it."	2	2		2																					
7569	3	"The features of the setting in ÒDo Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed LimitÓ affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1).

The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2		2																					
7572	3	"The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,Ó the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,Ó the features seriously impared his bike ride."	2	2		2																					
7574	3	"The features of the setting in ÒRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitÓ greatly affect the cyclist. IÕm sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in Òthe california desert in the middle of JuneÓ does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, IÕm sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldnÕt continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke."	3	2		3																					
7578	3	"According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states ÒI had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in JuneÓ. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states Òover one long, crippling hill, a building came into viewÓ. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclistÕs trip and how it affected her."	3	3		3																					
7589	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,ÒThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke Ó This meant the heat was getting to him."	1	1		1																					
7590	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, Òcame to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldnÕt hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.Ó Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel.

7593	3	"IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist seeÕs the sign that says, ÒRough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.Ó So the cyclist has to be cautious"	1	1		1																					
7595	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasnÕt a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
7603	3	"The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things."	1	1		1

Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again."	1	2		2																					
7615	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, Ò... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,Ó By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7619	3	"The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ÒThis sight was troublingÉI had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.Ó With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called Òeasy way out.Ó "	1	1		1																					
7623	3	"Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, ÒThat I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.Ó Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.Ó Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.Ó Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June."	3	3		3																					
7628	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, Òflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, Òthrough the high deserts of California in June.Ó This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder."	2	2		2																					
7642	3	"The setting in ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed LimitÓ has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ÔtownÕ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. ÒThe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.Ó His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like ÒrushingÓ being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. ÒNot two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.Ó At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isnÕt what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, ÒThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. ÒThis adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him.

The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well.

This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him."	2	3		3																					
7698	3	"The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, ÒFlat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hillsÓ (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills donÕt help any eigther."	2	1		2																					
7704	3	"In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, ÒI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.Ó  "	2	2		2																					
7707	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, Òover one crippling hillsÉÓ with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isnÕt careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking heÕll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water."	2	2		2																					
7708	3	"The features of the setting in ÒRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed LimitÓ greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. "	2	3		3																					
2993	1	"i believed that the author did not convince me that winning a war against poverty is achievable in life because parents didnÕt send their kids to school because they couldnÕt afford it. for example, many kids in sauri did not attend school because parents could not afford school fees. they need to maintain the food supply, and these goals are suppose to set off by 2015. another reason is that they get a dollar everyday but they need 5 dollars. the reason they need 5 dollars is because they can buy a net to keep mosquitos away for 5 years. the disease ÒmaleriaÓ kills 20,000 children everyday, and it can save 1 million lifes. the last reason is that they need many things that they canÕt get something they can get are fertilizers, schools supplies, and medicine. they also need a net to keep mosquitos away. last thing they need is to be capable of their goal."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
2998	1	"i think the milliennium villages project can prevent poverty.  it is going to take time but it will not happen in a lifetime.  poverty is always going to be in our life.  itÕs a part of the human life society cycle and we canÕt help it.  this project will help the poverty percent rate go lower.  if people are willing to help and volunteer, we can acheive it faster. the disease, malaria, is very preventable.  the bed net only cost $5 each.  my school allowance every week is $10, i could help pay 2 bed nets if i wanted to.  the progress that they made in sauri and the sub-saharan villages are promising. firtelizers and irrigation is one of the biggest problem.  itÕs always the food that they need.  we canÕt function very well without food, well i canÕt function well without it.  water is the main key to survive.  without it weÕll die from dehydration.  creating irrigation system to all 80 villages are outstanding.  it can cure a lot of disease and help people survive. school is the key to sucess.  people who are in middle school with below 4th grade reading level (in california) can lead to high school dropouts and the person who did the crime, that are betweem 25-16 years of age are 96.4% percent drop outs of high school.  to see the people in africa wants to go to school, even without the supplies just amazes me.  they have the intelligence and persivirance that can lead to a beautiful country. in conclusion, with all these key factors that i saw in the essay/journal we read.  we can lessen the poverty rate by a large amount in africa.  if they continew with the project, we can change/prevent poverty and we can maybe, just maybe, have a great balance of economy in their country.  this made me think about how much privilage i have as an american.  people just want more that we forget we are not the only one in the world."	3	2		2	2	2	2																		
2999	1	yes because the author showed it was possible for someone else to win against poverty. she was a girl who wants to make changes to the world and she did it. so i believe that anyone else can do it. she proved that things can change if you put your effort and help people.	3	3		0	3	2	3																		
3002	1	"in my opinion the author said that we can win the proverty but i don't think so becaus this stroy was just about one place but there are alots of places that have proverty. they got rid of the proverty in this place but theres still like half of the world left. people can't donate, volunteer for the whole world. so i think we can never get rid of proverty because not all the people donate money for each places of proverty and even though some people donate money and other stuff they still need more importan stuff because for example all the donation got spend on clothing and food but what about the waters, electricity and others. so what if this one places got rid of proverty, what about the other countries it's not fair to them! so thats why i think it's impossible to get rid of proverty, but the author did convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time because atleast one place in down but still have to help the others. we can even share it with the whole world all the stuff. and they had better life after 4 years so you just have to be patient with time. so it will get better and better each year and they also need to work together."	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3003	1	"have you ever heard of the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya? this project is really helpful because in just four years, there was a big difference. the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free of charge for all diseases, there was water, electricity and bed nets. Òthere are no school fees, and the schools now serve lunch for the students.Ó the kids now have energy to concentrate. one thing that the millennium villages project improved was having bed nets in every sleeping site. there was a disease called malaria that is common in africa, which is caused by mosquitoes. they infect people by biting them. a bed net keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. it costs $5, but people wasnÕt able to afford it. there are also some cheap medicines to get rid of malaria, but still 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. in 2008, bed nets are in every sleeping site, so less people will get the disease. in the article by hanah sachs, it did convine me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. the author convinced me because she told me all the changes that happened in just four years. Òwater is connected to the hospital, which was also a generator for electricity.Ó in 2004, there was no running water or electricity. Òthere are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for the studentsÓ in 2004, schools had minimal supplies and so midday meal. it was really hard for students to concentrate and they had no more energy. Òthe hunger crises has been adressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as tools needed to maintain the food supplyÓ in 2004, the farmerÕs crops were dying because they canÕt afford the neccessary fertilizer and irrigation. they have and outcome of poor crops because of the lack of fertilization and water i think the millennium project in sauri, kenya really made a change in peopleÕs lives. there was such a big chance in just four years. i think the millennium project would make an even bigger change in peopleÕs lives by 2015 or 2025. the millennium project helped a lot of people and saved a lot of lives."	4	4		2	3	3	3																		
3021	1	"the author hannah sachs convinced me that we can win this battle because in the text it states that in 2004 when the children in kenya went to school their parent didnÕt have enough money to pay school fee so some kids didnÕt go to school.  teachers didnÕt have enough supplies like crayons, pencils, paper, and other things.  and teachers didnÕt have enough money so that children could have lunch.  when the kids was trying to learn they couldnÕt because they was so very hungry.  all the kids in the school really wanted to learn.  some other problems that people in kenya had was that there was flies, and when you are sleep they would come out.  so the people had put nets on their beds so that the bugs wouldnÕt bite them but it wouldnÕt only last for five years, and the nets cost $5, and the adults only made $1 dollar a day because they didnÕt have enough money.  in 2004 there was not electricity, and no nurses when people was in the hospital dying, and almost dying, and about to die, and even children who was sick.  there was no water in kenya, and i bet if there was it was dirty brown water.  when farmers grew crops they die, and the worry, and wonder if there would be enough food for their family.  almost 20,000 kids died of many disease each day.  the kids was very hungry, and sick.  time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer, and water.  some have to do chores to help such as fetching water, and wood.  in 2008 the hospital has medicine, for all common diseases, and it is a free charge.  water is also connected to the hospital which also has a generator for electricity.  bed nets are used in every sleeping site.  the farmers now have fertilizer, and water, and seeds.  as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supplies.  there are no school fees, and children can eat lunch now, and stay on task, and have energy.  the attendance rate is way up.  schools now have the school supplies, crayons, pencils, paper, books, and other things.  and the farmers can feed their whole family, because the crops do not die anymore."	4	4		3	3	4	3																		
3022	1	"yes, because there are halping people who are dying and trying to save the people that have malaria. were it says Òa better life paragraph its four years later and sauri made a amazing progress. in 2008 the yala sub-district hospital has medicane. they have food for the adults and children. they have water connected to the hospital. this convice me also because the millennium villages were helping out for the children. but on the first page were it says Òthe fight for better health. the hospital wasnÕt in good shape, the medicane treatment wasnÕt good for the patient. there wasnÕt water or electricity. all of these things happen in 2004 until 2008 came and had money, medicane for patient, has water and electricity. all of these good things happen in 2008 and im proud of it, thatÕs how the millennium villages won the healthing fight."	4	3		1	4	4	4																		
3033	1	"how can i give you 3-4 example from text 4 example.rthe afican wanted to learn but they didnt have food at school. sauri lived on less than one dollar a day.it was not good to get sick cause over there it can cause you to die. there were three kid to a bed and to adult to the bed. the room was packed with patients who probabaly would not recevie treatment, wither because the hospital did not have it or the patient could not afford it. but people that help ship food tha would be but i gotto say my personal opinion is i think it sad cause we throw away food we don't finish that the afcain will  want to eat i think one say the people that think it funny that it will backfila them someday you are going to run out of money and go hungry. today will see the same thing that we step at a light people are saleing thing like water,juice,donut,flower they will do anything to get some change for them to eat."	4	4		1	3	4	3																		
3041	1	"yes,  because kenya made it possible for curing the sickness from people. and the author said it was'nt gonna be an easy task to do but it is possible becouse it took four years just to do and cure that it will be kind of hard. the millennium villages project helped the people alot and when they saw the hospital they were shocked. it is sad that every single day 20,000 kids died from maleria that is just shocking for people. it could be acheivable becouse one they have alot of medication to make 2 united states or people could donate food to them each day 3 people could make the price down of the bed nets so most people could afford it easier."	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3055	1	"i think that the plan will work. i say that because: if they did it for sauri in 4 years they can help out every where in about 2035 or 2025, but thatÕs only if we try! since they got bed nets for every sleeping site in sauri we can get, that for the homeless people. the miliennium village project helped people from being hungry in just 4 years. we can pobably do the same, but it may take time. the kids in sauri had no clean clothes on. there were people waking with no shoes. the millennium village project changed all that in just 4 years. we can do that with everyones help; we can do better then the millennium project, by helping out the whole world. with everyoneÕs help we wonÕt have people, & kids homeless. we wont have people without clean clothes to wear. they sad that little kids were wraped up in a blanket with their parents. now itÕs not like that. the millennium village project is the reason that sauri isnÕt as bad as it was."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3057	1	i think the author convince that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because it can help people. winning the fight against poverty make people feel happier. and if we fight against poverty we will have school supplies lunch and machine and water in the hospital. we can also make everyone more glad. the fight against poverty is very important to our life time.	3	2		0	3	2	3																		
3064	1	"because, kids in united state can learn about kenya about thing to donÕt get an disease. kenya had a school there. you can learn more about there. for example: you can under stand that they can farm there to survie. they can survie form the mosquitoes carry malaria. they uses a bed net to protect them self. the millenniun villages project was the place would change dramatically in coming years. the villages project created to help reach to the millennium development goals."	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3074	1	"introduction: the reason i am writing this essay is to tell people about why millennium villages is a poor sad place. in 2012 people today get paid 20$, 50$, 100$ even 1,0000$. in some resturants to eat is 50$, 200$. in fast food its $6.95. i am going to write the four examples. one example of the millennium village is, the mosquiets called malaria. to me the word malaria sounds like something that can make you sick for a couple of hours then make you feel better. in millennium you could have a possibility of death at my age. the disease mostly show up at night. they had to use bed nets to use chemical for to help cure the people from the disease. the hospital only has one doctor in millennium village. another example the schools, they are cutting low on school taxed. some kids in there school can't afford to go because the parents get paid a dollor a day. the kids in my school has all the books, pencils, paper and more but some time they are probably missing one or two supplies in. other village they only have a minimum of supplies. they are having trouble with the water so they can drink something. and they also have trouble with the electricity so they can see from the dark. one last thing is the state, there state looks big but got not alot of people. some people come there to help. but even why they do help it turns out bad at the end sometimes. in shops"	4	5		1	4	4	4																		
3078	1	"after reading this article, i am convinced that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.  i am convinced of this because in the beginning of the article, the author was writing about all the common problems, such as hunger, thirst, and malaria.  however, to conclude the article, the author was explaining how villages across sub-saharan africa were experiencing dramatic changes.  medicine is now in hospitals at no cost.  malaria and other diseases can be treated, resulting in a longer lifetime and a lower deathrate.  the occupants of the villages now have water and electricity, as well.  the farmers are also supplied with fertilizer, an object they were lacking four years back.  based on these changes (that took only four years) i am very convinced that it is possible to win the fight against poverty within our lifetime."	3	2		2	3	2	3																		
3087	1	"Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ is a big change and step-up even for a small town. in this article the author gave examples of how sauriÕs poverty changed drasticly in four years (2004-2008). but it takes money. for example $5 a net you think is cheap but when there are 100,000 kids, you would have to raise or donate all that money! easy solutions are brought up, but getting those items or solutions may not seem easy after all. to stablelize a whole economy of poverty is a real challenge. it may happen in your lifetime because you have more to live. but for all those dieing people, innocent people, and people who have been waiting for it to happen, their life may escape out of the grasp of your hands. i do believe it is possible, but it will require time and paitience, and hard work from both sides. just because you give the schools 10 year or less of supplies, it will eventually disappear, then you have to support the school again (donate more)"	2	2		1	3	3	3																		
3101	1	"i donÕt think poverty can be banished in our life time, i think it can vanish within time but not with just one lifetime. i mean the author said it was going to be hard and i agree with that, but i also think it can be done. if other wealthy countries help out it will go away in time, but what happens to the wealthy countries, theyÕll soon run out of money as well. many may help shove away poverty, and donate money, but they can only donate as much as they can aford to donate. if they had billions of dollars yah that would help, but how many countries can that pay for? one, maybe two at the max. what if they didnÕt have enoughe money to donate? nobody would judge them, but they constantly are struggling as well. shouldnÕt people help them? even in rich countries people starve when they donÕt have money to buy food, or pay bills. i think maybe this united nations should give money to every country. it doesnÕt even have to be a lot, they could donate a small amont of money, and that would help. if everyone donates a dollar to these people in kenya that would help right? for those in kenya who donÕt have a home, they should make a shelter, and in due time the country could be an even better place. others love to donate to countries like kenya. many do and will donate, or give money. they may not be rich, but they still would like to help. kenya is a better place already, but povertity canÕt just vanish in a life time. many have tried to make proverty disappear in their life. only the dent the problem a little. in order for poverty to completely vanish everyone in the world would have to donate. they might not even solve the problem then. perhaps they should donate a little to each country make all countries a little stronger. many want and wish for poverity to end. although many might not be able to help or do anything about it. a lot of people donate to schools so they have a better chance for their children, but thatÕs one school. that is nothing compared to countries and people who are suffering. poverty will vanish completely eventually, but not yet. maybe in a couple of years. but not yet, not yet. others canÕt donate but wish they could. i would donate to countries like kenya if i could, or had the money. others make or buy food to donate to place like kenya. like i said poverty wonÕt vanish yet, but it will one day. Òafter all itÕs the thought that counts.Ó"	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3107	1	"for the fight for better health a lot of children and adults die because of malaria. the hospitals didn't have any water or electricity. the hospitals didn't have the medicines to help with the people with malaria the farmer's crops always died because there was a lack of fertilizer and irrigation. every year the farmers worry if their children would starve. many kids in sauri didn't attend school because they didn't have enough money to pay for the fees. some kids had to stay home to do chores. the schools in sauri didn't have much supplies for the kid. the kids didn't get lunch, and by the end of the day they were out of energy. in 2008, everything changed. the hospitals had water, medicines, and electric generators. the farmes got the water and fertilizer they need. the schools had more supplies and lunches for the kids. more kids started school because there was no more school fees. they accomplished this all in four years. in another 3-4 years they would have accomplished everything they needed, so yes, i think they would be able to win the fight againts poverty."	3	4		2	4	3	4																		
3108	1	"Òis winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime?Ó i think that winning the fight against poverty can be done if everyone isnÕt as greedy and help other people out. if everyone helps out and donates at least two dollars a day then we can definitly win. mosquitoes carry malaria at night and when they bite someone they have to go to the hospital. thereÕs no point in going to the hospital because there arenÕt enough docters to much patients that are all crambed in one room, and patients have to share beds. winning the fight against poverty could help children with education, bigger schools, more supplies. we could also have better hospitals and more docters to take care of patients. there are three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed and the hospital is always packed with patients, and there arenÕt enough docters. some people might say that they dont think we could win the fight against poverty because more and more people become greeder and greeder each day. i disagree with statement because once everyone sees how important this is and they think about they people who die giving birth, dont have clean water, and enough medicine, and how grateful we are that we have clean water, that we can walk and that we have medicine they should be donating money and if they arenÕt they are selfish people. i think winning the fight against poverty because if everyone donates money and helps out then it is definitly possible. in every country that isnÕt in poverty should have a small building that holds all the money s donations for other countrys in poverty. then when we have enough money for other countrie in poverty then we should send the money to the poor countries and help them build bigger hospitals, schools, and get more docters, and school supplies. everyone who doesnÕt helpout will become more greedy everyday."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3116	1	the author convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time because sauri could no afford any thing for example people in sauri could not afford water for plants and people in in school could not concetrate because there was not fertilizer to grow crops and people in sauri were dieing because a disease because there is not bed nets and there is no doctor and now people are cored and the have food because they have money and water to grow the crops to get food that concludes the story of sauri.	3	3		1	4	3	4

3127	1	"in these article, hannah sachs convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,Ó by the section Òthe fight for better health.Ó first, mosquitoes has a disease called malaria. if mosquitoes bite kids, they can die from it easily, and also adults could get very sick. they can protect mosquito bites by using bed net, which they cost five dollar, but it was too expensive for people who lived in kenya. but four years later, people in kenya are able to use bed nets. before, hospitals were packed in patients because of the malaria. now they are using bed nets in every sleeping site. i think they can now afford the bed nets in every sleeping site because they were fighting against poverty. i think it is difficult to change, but i think poverty is achievable in our lifetime. another example is in the section called Òwater, fertilizer, knowledgeÓ. people in kenya were starving because their crops were dying. they didnÕt have a fertilizer and water, they had a seeds to plant but the seeds canÕt grow unless they put fertilizer and water. also they didnÕt have a fees to let kids to attend school. the kids in kenya wanted to learn but they didnÕt have money. but four years later, they were able to get fertilizer and water. also there are no school fees so they can learn as much as they want. school serves lunch for students so they wonÕt be able to starve. in four years later everything changed. winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime!"	3	3		2	3	3	3

3130	1	"the author convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime, because it had already started to happen. the millenium project has helped many people in many different ways. one example is, not many children went to school, either because they had to help their parents, fetch water and wood, or because they didnÕt have the money. children who went to school were eager to learn with the few supplies they had. and, at the end of the day they had no energy because the school didnÕt serve lunch. now children can go to school, and have lunch. another example, why the author convinced me, was that farmers were given the tools, and fertilizer they need to grow crops, and harvest them. now lots of people can feed their family because their crops were beginning to produce more food than before. so, that they can feed their families to give them energy to work, and to sell some of their crops to earn money. the last reason, the author convinced me with, was that people caught malary because they could not afford the net which protected them from mosquitos at night. that was one common way people caught malaria, but some people could not afford it. even the cheap medicine some people couldnÕt afford. even when they took the victims to the hospital they were not treated because they could not be tended because it was too expensive. now every sleeping sight has mosquito nets and the hospital treats for no charge. i think the fight against poverty can be won if we all pitch in and help."	4	3		2	4	3	4																		
3133	1	"yes, i beleive that poverty is acheivable in human-kind! however i didnÕt that like that. when i just started reading in the middle. it talks about human in sauri live on one dollar, however lots of student everyday atleast buy a bag of chips, when they go out, and a bag of chip is already more than $1. secondly the childs wearing no shoes, and ragged shoes. average human right now in san francisco is wearing shoes that are more than $10, (10 days of living in sauri), and wear fancy and neat clothing. lastly they said hospital had no money, no water, no electricty, so all that made me on the bad side, but lives started to change, with my mine! when they started saying hospite had free medical fee for average sickness, and free education for kids! i beleive school is a very important thing in a scessful soceity, because it will help the next generation build on the soceity like a cycle. that made me think on the positive side, and a poverty is acheiveable."	4	3		2	4	3	4																		
3144	1	i think that the author did try and convcice us about the article an statement of Òwinning the fight aganistt poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ the author gives us details about the hiveing condtions of the peope of kenya. the author also tells us of the change in the last 4 years due to the project. the author also tells us about how the project has changed the health care and the living. the author also tells us how they with increase the amount of care threw out the years. the also has convinced us that they can double the villages that they already have changed. i also am convinced that this millennium development project will help the poverty in kenya and othe villages. i am convinced that the millennium project will help the contry a lot in there growing poverty. i hope that the sauri village will help other poverty enviroments reach out and get help and change there environment and help there furture	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3148	1	"i think yes because each year they are improving and getting supplies that they need to survive, like it says they have water & electricity in the hospital and they sleep in bed nets. they have fertilizer so many people in sauri can eat more and live more than $1 a day. more and more kids are attending school, they donÕt have to pay for it so itÕs very helpful to the childrens families that are in poverty. they also serves lunch @ the school, and they have the tools for the crops so that helps end the hunger crisis. the hospital has medicine thats free too and that helps the population stay stable. this is all good signs of improvment and soon, the world will have less and less poverty-stricken areas."	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
3149	1	"i say yes because sauri made progress. they have a hospital, free charge for all of the most common disease. water is connected to the hospital and it is powered by a geneator. bed nets are used for ever spleeping site in sauri. the school had no fees and they had lunch for the kids. the schools attendance rate was really high. the school had all the supplies they needed. kids that want to learn can no go to school. there was enough health care for everybody. the millennium planned to help them get a better life by getting people out of poverty, access to health care and stabilize the economy. the millennium had to help the sauri get all the supplies, medicines, and fertilizers they need. many people were dieing because a disease called malaria gets in them. mosquitos carry that disease at night time. only bed nets could keep them from biteing you. since good luck started happening, in every sleeping site the is a bed net inside. all of the other villages will soon have good luck like sauri and it is possible to make a poor village a better place."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3152	1	"hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools need to maintain the food supply. yes i agree."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3154	1	"yes, because the hospitals have all change. there is medical. also there is electricty. there goal is to be done by 2015. they are making alot of changes. theyÕre helping afica. the kids proboly have beter cloths. the town is now a livly place to live. they made a differentness. thats how the author convinced me that they can win. i agree with the aurthor. she made a differeness. i hope she writes more so that way the wold can be a safer place. the kids need shoes, food, and more. the roads need to change and get concreate. africa can change form just alittle girls story. most beds needs nets to not die and stuff. this needs to change. last but not least is the jobs. the people are only getting $1 a day and bed nets cost $5 and only last for 5 years. some were homeless or on a deaf bed. but now it has changed. there is eletricty, food, water. in 2015 afica would be better and probaly have halth care. donÕt forget the kidÕs education. they need meals, pencials, and books. in 2025 if would be awsome. hope it happens and change."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3160	1	"the author did convince that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime"". because of the way the author explained how many villages were helped in just 4 years. they had dramatic changes to help the village as far as hospitals and health plans and school fares. these are all examples of a better life in kenya. hospitals now are bigger, has free admision - no bills, and has medicine for preventable deasese like malaria. they have more rooms and more beds to where some people don't have to share. and now instead of some clinical officer they have doctors to care for patients and put them on the right path to a healthy life. doctors are a bid improvement and a huge help to kenya society. health plans are also keeping people healthy. they give medicine to the person for desease and other medical problems like malaria and disease of body parts such as the heart, lungs and liver. school taxes have been removed making the enrollment rate way high. that also means more and more kids are learning every day and becoming smarter. all in all kenya has impoved dramatically in just 4 years."	3	4		2	4	4	4																		
3161	1	"yes, the author is convince that we can win the fight against poverty. in 2004 there were most people how were poverty. in 4 years from 2004 they were doing good they had bed nets, water, food, and eletricity. i know they will win the fight against the poverty. they will get the money from the usa."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3174	1	"poverty is a big deal in our lives. there are a lot of things to do to end it. but if we all work together, we can end it. one way we can end it is to send school supplies to countries that are poor. if children can get and education, they could get a job. jobs give you money. once they get enough money, they can also help fight poverty the more and more people who help end poverty, the more likely it will end. another way to end poverty is to send money to hopitals. the more money hospitals get, the more medication and equiptment they can get. when hospitals get medicane, they can treat people with diseases like malaria and aids. hospitals could also give out bed nets to prevent diseases. people would also have to be aware of poverty. the more people who know about what poverty does, more people will help end poverty. they would aslo about poverty and spread the information. we should also send farming tools and fertilizer. if people can make their own food, and maybe extra, they could survive and make money. those are just a few ways to end poverty. the littlest things can make a difference."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3177	1	"i think the article, did convince me ""that wining the fight against poverty"" is achievable in our lifetime because if people do not have school supplies, medicine and food how will they survive. in paragraph 3 sentence 1 it says the plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of like in their communities. in paragraph 4 sentence 6,7 it says there was no running water or electricity. it is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases people who are near death when they shouldn't have to be."	1	2		0	1	1	1																		
3184	1	"yes i do think hanna sachs persuaded me that project millenneum villages will succeed.  she persuaded me because of all the facts she said such as: -in 2004 Òthe yala-sub district hospital was not in good shape.  there three kids to a bed and two adults to a bed.  the rooms were full of patients who probably would not recieve treatment either because hospital did not have it or the patient could not afford it.Ó  it states in paragraph 1 of the fight for better healthe.  then in 2008 the yala-sub district hospital has water connected to it, wich creates energy, and there is a bed net a bed net on every bed.  that shows that they can do alot to end poverty. -in 2004 Òmany kids in sauri could not attend school because thier parents could not afford school fees.  some kids were needed for chores, such as fetching water and wood.  the schools had minimal supplies...Ó the kids did not even have enough food to eat.  in 2008, Òthere are no school fees, and the school now serves lunch for students.  the attendance rate is way up.Ó  that tells me that if we work hard and together the millenneum villages project will succeed."	3	3		2	3	3	3																		
3187	1	"hannah sachs, the author of Òa brighter futureÓ was able to convince me that poverty is escapeable in my lifetime. by describing the progress in sauri, kenya in a before and after format i could really see what the millennium villages project does for villages like sauri. i believe that fertilizer and water are the most important things to help improvished communities worldwide. the main reason that i was convinced that poverty will be history by the next generation is the way the facts were presented. the arguments were presented by first describing sauri as the project first began. next, she described the project, its goals, and the plan. finally she showed the positive effects of the millennium villages project. this format was convincing because it showed progress, while showing what more can be done for people living in poverty. another aspect of the essay that was very convincing was ways that we can help people in villages like sauri. an example of this would be, Òeach net costs $5, the solution is simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day.Ó this shows how we can help, and the devasting effects of not having a net. by showing the effects of poverty through disease, the author lets people know that we too can help in the fight against poverty. what made the essay interesting was the narrative format. instead of stating facts and what we could do, she told us how she had seen sauri. this was much more persuasive than stating facts. by showing the effects of poverty on children she made the reader feel very empathetic. by showing a typical day in schools she showed connections between farmers and education. in her words, Òthe people of sauri made amazing progress in just four years.Ó she showed the positive effects of fertilizer on learning. this essay was very persuasive because she showed positive effects instead of only how sauri could be further helped. she also wrote in a narrative, before and after format, which describes the progress to someone who hasnÕt seen sauriÕs progress firsthand. by showing how we can help people in poverty, she made us feel less helpless while giving clear suggestions of how to help. all in all i think hannah sachs is a very convincing author."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3188	1	"i think it is achievable: they have already made progress. in Òa better life-2008Ó, it states how the places have improved. the hospital had medicine for all common diseases, water for the patients, and an electricity generator. bed nets are used to prevent mosquitos from giving people malaria while they sleep. farmers can grow crops, now that they have fertilizer and seeds. there are no school fees, and the kids are served lunch. we still have work to do. the people still live on $1 a day. we can start a charity sauri, we can also have a food drive for them. another problem there is in sauri is their clothes. we can help the kids, too.  we can donate clothes, so they donÕt have to wear tattered clothes. together, we can make sauri a better place."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3197	1	"chan_020069429 yes,, i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime should be in the history. it is because the author tells that living in sauri, kenya is very bad because you only use $1 or less than $1 in one day. maybe the work is hard and you get less money or the food is too expensive so they use $1 or less each day. the author and other people had a plan. the plan is to get people out of poverty. help them get healther and helther. give them some items: such as fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. so they can get a better life. in africa, there is a disease called malaria. mosquitoes carry malaria. kids can die from the disease and adults can get sick. people can buy nets so the mosquitoes canÕt bite you, but the net course a lot about 200,000 kids die from the disease each day. because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation, their crops were dying. we should give more school supplies so the kids can get a better by going to school. before 2004, the hospital has no water, medicine, and electricity. now they got everything. the water and electricity was connected and there is more medicine. so we should gave more fertilizer, medicine and school supplies."	3	4		1	3	3	3																		
3200	1	"the author does convince me winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime is achievable. in a better life-2008 the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases. that is another win against poverty. water and electricity is connected to the hospital. before, many people couldnÕt afford to buy bed nets because it was too expensive. they only lived on one dollar a day. after four years of the millennium villages project everyone had a bed net, they were all over sauri. fertilizer, seeds, and tools were addressed. now there are no school fees, and lunch is served. the attendance rate is now up. these are little steps to fight and win against poverty. in Òa brighter futureÓ by hannah sachs she talks about how poverty can be fought and how in sauri they can overcome it. in conclusion hannah sachs convinces me winning the fight against poverty in our lifetime is achievable."	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3207	1	"yes he made me belive because people have been making fundraser and no because the world is very greedy and want people to keep fighitng and make the world violance. i think the world would be safer if people gave poor people resources when they need them their would be less war and gangs. kenya would be safer with hospital, police, money, and more school so that 100 people are not in one class they also need better books and make school free for the people of kenya. they should start their own foundation like red cross or the hati foundation to donate money for the things they need. i think the usa wont help unless they give the usa something thats why we might not happen. the usa wont help kenya africa unless it benifis us or they give us money or give us thing usa need kenya or we take over them."	3	3		0	4	3	4																		
3213	1	"peek_020023765 i donÕt think Òthe war on povertyÓ is acheivable in our lifetime but it maybe acheivable in our childrens lifetime. i think a more realistic thing the author could have said is Òwinning the war on poverty in kenya is acheivable in our lifetime. i donÕt know if  the author thought that in our lifetime the world will see no poverty or if it was just a poor choice of words. in my opinion, if somebody wanted to get rid of poverty we would have to do step by step and do the little things first, like what the millennium villages did i believe we can get rid of poverty in kenya in our lifetime but we canÕt get rid of poverty all over the world in our lifetime. lets say you were born in 2004 which was when the author was first brought to sauri. by 2025 you would be 21 and hopefully the people of sauri would not live in poverty. but think about it, it took 21 years for that to happen and  believe it or not there are countryÕs and cities worse off then sauri. lets say you live to be 85 you would have gotten rid of poverty in 4-5 cities like sauri."	4	3		0	4	3	4																		
3218	1	"hannah proved that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable because first they didn't have health care. second they had no medicine to treat anyone. third they all had dirty water. fourth all of the crops were dying. but now everthing is better. they have medicine. they now have clean water, more kids are attending school and everyone is safe from malaria. the hospitals had no fresh water and no electricity. it was in such bad shape that there was more than one person to a bed. there were many people near death with sicknesses that could be prevented but they didn't have medicine. the farmer's had crops that were dying because they weren't fertilized or watered. every year the farmers wonder: will we have enough food to feed the family? will their kids go hungry and get sick? they couldn't drink they would get sick and probably die from a disease or paresite in the water. schools weren't so great either there were barely any kids there. one reason is that they had to work on the farm. the other is that they couldn't afford it. there was little school supplies. there were no mid-day meals. at the markets women would sit on the dusty ground and sell bananas to the people the kids would run around in tattered clothes. babies would wear cloth strapped around them to their mom. in 2015 short term or 2025 longterm the people of sarui, kenya will have a better life. they will have better health care. more of the children will go to school. people will have fresh water. they will have more medicines to sure more people."	3	3		2	4	4	4																		
3221	1	"yes, this artical convonce me because being poor is not a good way. if the ned net cost $5 they cant buy food if they buy the bed net. if they win the fight they can buy food, bednets, water, and school suplies. if they can win they will have enough money to buy lunch for school to eat so the children do run out of energy. they will provide medicine too. if they lost the fight 20,000 kid will die from the disease each day. they will have to use less than $1 each day. some family didn't afford to go to school because they can't afford it. in the year of 2008 hospital gave medicne and help people change that have disease for free. bed net is used for hospital the used to sleep there. they don't have water and fertilizer to grow crops to eat. if the children and adult do have lunch at school or don't have dinner to eat them will get side or die. they have to word togeter and earn crop and food togeter and eat."	3	4		1	4	3	4

3231	1	the author did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life time because in 2008 poverty is no longer a problem. although the program donated money and fertilizer so there would be plants and so they couldnÕt be poor any more. dramatic changes have accurred in 80 villages.	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3241	1	134501y2_ 000460932 the reason why i thinkg poverty is achievable is that even i my slef is not invloed with poverty. i can see people in poverty infest area can make a dramatic change in the econtanmy.	1	1		0	1	1	1																		
3244	1	yes i do think it would be achivible with in our life time to achive the fight for keya because if you went from $5 of medicine to free medice and from fees to go to no fees for school and from no fertelizer and seed now they have that kind of stuff to make to make food so yes i do belive we can echive this goal with a little help.	2	2		1	3	3	3																		
3247	1	"property should end because over 20,000 kids are dieing from disease each day. and i think that otheir should be more food because peoples kids get hungry and later became sick and starve to death. what would make a better life is if their are more hospitals that have medicine to make sure anyone gets sick or gets disease from anything and another thing that can make a better life is if they can give away bed nets for every one who does not have one. another thing that can make a better life is that schools can give lunch for the kids."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3256	1	"Òa better futureÓ by hannah sachs tries to convince readers that we will get people out of poverty in our lifetime. i am definately convinced. some ways she did this include getting bed nets for everyone, having no school fees, and getting the proper medical attention each person needs. sachs tells the reader that when she went back to sauri in 2008 that Òbed nets were used in every sleeping site.Ó if this can happen in one village, it can happen in every village. further more, in 2008, there were Òno school fees... the attendence rate was way up.Ó once these students grow up with an education and they have kids it will influence their kids to go to school. this may go on for generation after generation. finally the hospitals Òhad medicine, free of charge, for all of the most common diseases.Ó this convinces the reader that once people are cured of their disease they may go on to do many other things. for example, go back to school, then get a job and have a happy life. Òif every village is like sauri and can make as much progress as sauri than we will become very successful. sauri is just the start of what might become Òwinning the fight against poverty.Ó"	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
3257	1	yes because i did not think it was possible to achive winning the fight against proverty. when they won i did not think they would but they did. it was incredible on how they won. they did very well. i thouhgt that they wouldn't win because most of the time they were sick. when they were sick all of the sick people layed in one bed. the people were very sick. but the fought the sickness and won. all of this had happened in 2004. when they were sick the 3 kids had to sleep in one bed. two adults needed to sleep in one bed also. it is a good thing that they are now healthy. while they were still sick there was no doctor. with no doctor the could have died. if there was no such thing as bed nets they would not be alive at all. its a good things they used medecine to get better.	1	1		0	1	1	1																		
3268	1	"the author did convinces me because every thing can be solved. even poverty can be solved in some parts of the world. people solved the problem of bed nets were solved so now people cant get hurt by does mean mosquitoes. another reason why i agree with that part is that now people have a better health and more energy. the reason they have more energy is because the have fertilizer for the plants and they get more water, the good thing is that kids don't got sick. the 3 reason why the phrase convinced me was because the hospital now gets mor electricity witch every hospital needs. the second thing they get allot is water, water and electricity are some things that hospitals need for the patients."	3	3		1	3	2	3																		
3291	1	"i think that in my lifetime this argument can work because before i read this i was already convinced, but when the author gave more reasons to believe it. first of all, by 2076 (when i'm 75) it will be acheived because africa, (kenya) is a very poverty write now so if they start saving kenya will have money. also, if america pitches in they will have cures for every diesease in the book. then, we can pay for beds + toys + clothes for the kids. another reason is to make sure the children get the nutrients + fiber they need to stay hydrated + to make sure they don't have to work. finally - for their education in the article the author said ""some kids can't go to school because their parents can't afford school fees. this was somethings that kenya needs help for."	5	5		0	4	4	4																		
3294	1	"yes, it is achievable  to win the fight against poverty because  in the text  did something. for example, the people s sauri had medicine to treat different diseases. also  for example , they now have water cfonnected  to the hospital which also has a generator for electricity. also , they have bed net to keep malaria carrying mosquitos away from sleeping patients. all of these  things done by people helped stop poverty in sauri. the milleninium  villages help stop poverty. for example the schools now serve lunch to the students. also , the hunger crisis is gone because farmers have fetilizer and seeds to grow cops."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3295	1	"the author hanah sachs convinced me you can make a difference. a lot of kids could not afford to pay the fee, also they had not got a lot of supplies. also the farm were not taken care of because the couldÕnt buy the materials such as water or seeds. and about 20,000 dies each day. from a disease that mosquitos carry and the disease is called malaria. but 2008 all that got better. the school became free. the farmers had water and seeds to plant food and also go the the school had lunches. and the malara cleared up. so in 2008 millinium village project did a lot in 2008."	3	4		2	4	4	4																		
3297	1	"the author thinks that kids in the united sates should learn about kenya because to see how horible it was and how kids were dieing every day. they should also learn how life was after to see how kenya improved and how they are doing now. before the millennium project life in kenya was bad kids were dieing. also they didnÕt have enough crops or food, and when kids went to school thet didnt have that much suplies. now kenya is better thet have enough food and water. also they got more suplies for the school and they eat lunch there now."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3302	1	"based on the title of the article i think that the author di show that this is an atainable goal. i think that if we all work together and put all of our time and resources into ending poverty. in the article it said that their goal for poverty is to end it in a time lapse of the year 2015-2025. i think it is possible if we all focus to make it all happen. in the text it also sayÕs that there is starvation and poverty because their crops are dying (only source of food) because they canÕt afford to buy fertilizer and the irragation they need. another thing that they would like to fix is better health benifits (hospitals, medicine, etcÉ). they would like to make the hospitals and other health facilities much beter with all the necessary medicines. they will also keep the health facilities cleaner and neater. they also want to better the education for the children. they will try to make the school systems better. they will have meals at school now so that they will not get tired or have no energy in class."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3305	1	"the author did convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life timeÓ. the reason why is because if you help those people that are poor, sick and hopeless, you will be achieved by saving all those people during your life time. in the text, the author wrote that in the millennium village in sauri, kenya, the people there barely has any treatment of marlaria, crops donÕt have enough irrigation and fertilization, and kids that attended school only have few supplies and they donÕt have enough energy because there was no midday meal. but, with the help from other people, now the villages life had becoming more better and better, and because of your help, you saved lots of peopleÕs life, kidsÕ future, helped the village to have better water and have eletricity. thatÕs how the author had convinced me."	3	3		1	3	3	3

3335	1	"winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because if organizations like, the united nations, keep on helping villages in poor countries, poverty will soon be a thing of the past. for example the millennium villages project helped a village in sauri, kenya make as amazing progress in just 4 years. i am convinced that we can elimanate poverty in our lifetime because of how many organizations and people are commited to help stop it. in sauri, kenya the millennium villages project helped in many ways. the author describes that when she is in sauri she saw little kids running around with bare feet and tattered clothing. she also explained that millennium development goals are so supposed to be met by 2015 and other goals by 2025. the author arrived in kenya. in the year 2004. she describes the yala sub-district hospital she was taken to. there was no running water or electricity, also there was no doctor and the rooms were packed with patients who would not recieve treatment because of the hospitals low resources. she also explained how malaria is a very common disease and that alot people die of it because they can't afford the medicine. they also visited farmers that could not afford fertilizer and irragation. their crops were dying and the farmers worried if they would be able to feed the whole family. over the time period 4 years the millenum villages project helped the village in sauri and turn it into a better place. the yala sub-district hospital recieved medicine and now people can access it free of charge. bed nets were installed in every sleeping site in sauri to prevent mosquitoes from causing malaria. kids now to go school and recieve an education with no school fees and a midday meal."	4	3		2	4	4	4																		
3347	1	"poverty is a big issue in this point in our life. however, i think that this problem is solvable in my lifetime. although, sauri was in extremely bad shape at the beginning of the article, it seems like it is getting better. the citizens of sauri seem very motivated. they know their town/village is struggling, but they want to try their hardest to make their lives easier and more enjoyable. according to the article, the people of sauri thought of solutions and are doing much better now. they did not just think about it; they actually took action. it took about four years to solve some of their major issues. for example, kids were not able to go to school in 2004 because there was a fee, but as of 2008, there is no fee. schools are free. already kids and other people are getting a better education. another example of a reason why this problem can be solved in our lifetime is people from outside africa, the united states of america, are being very generous and donating. sauri also decided that hospitals would be free to people with common diseases like malaria. as said in the article, malaria is very easy to prevent; all you need are bed nets which cost $5 dollars. the people in sauri in 2004 were not able to pay that amount. however, i am pretty sure that people have donated mosquito nets and due to those donations, the malaria rate is going down. the people who are living in this time are very able to donate things like mosquito nets. they just need a little push to take action. in the direction sauri is headed, i am sure they will be able to succeed in their fight to lessen poverty rates in their village(s) with the help of people outside of their village."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3354	1	"i do think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable. the work that was done from 2004-2008 made a difference is sauri. if it took 4 years to fix sauri, then it must be possible to fix the whole world. i also know that there are many groups that fight against poverty. it is true that i think that poverty can be overcome, but it may take longer than 13 years to finish. there is alot of poverty in this world and it will take a long time to fix it. some poverty is really bad too. groups will have to keep helping for  a long time to finish the job. if you don't keep helping, people will go back to poverty. there will also need to be more groups helping. churches and charities are already helping. if people raise awareness for this cause, more people may help overcome poverty. even just sending donations will help. you don't have to do long, hard, trips to other countries. new medicins are also being made. over time things like diseases will be easier to cure. things may also become cheaper. it may become easier to get water and fertilizer to  farms. more people may be able to go to school. whatever happens, we should all help to end poverty."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3362	1	"i think we could change because over time we have changed rules. like slaves, we changed that and now people are free. it just takes time for things to change. martin luther king for example, he changed things. if we have some facts and speak up all we need is some motivation. mlk did it because he spoke up. we just need a little push and sometime. couple years and things go right. itÕs hard, but itÕll comethrough. in this passage it says, Òthe people of sauri have made great progress in just 4 years.Ó this shows that it takes time to fix things. the rest of the paragraph is about how it improved. it means when you do something about itÕll help you. Òbut sauriÕs progress shows us all that the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó this means progress is possible. that even this late, we can still make a differrence. Òthere are many solutions to the problems that keep people from improvished.Ó there can be way to tell people that there are ways to help. when we work, we help. when stand up and speak, we help. all we have to do is say something. we just have to speak to the people, because we can make a difference. they just need to hear us clearly."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3369	1	"yes, we can stop poverty from making people have a bad life. by Òassuring them access to health care ad help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in there communities.Ó also Òmosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. a bed net, treated with chemicals that last for five years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people.Ó another thing we can do is help Òvillages get technical advice and practical items, such as fertilize, medicine and school supplies.Ó one more example of how to stop poverty is by making sure the have good shelter to live in. and by making sure they have clean clothing to wear. they should also be able to have every thing they need. so if i ever have a chance to help i would, but for now i am waiting for that chance to come."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3376	1	"she is convincing because look how she talk it's so true. i would give them money one dallor in that country in 1 million dallors. when i heard that i was so happy i would give them one hundred dallors and that will be a billion of dollars. i support her thinking because it is true and she also right about the children being hungry. they need a fertilzer if necessary because if they don't they won't have food. i feel bad for them because there poor, i wish i could give them money. there are dramatic changes occuring in 80 villages across sub-sahran africa. the world will work together to change the world so they won't suffer.with no water and food they will not make it. it will not be easy, but sauri's progress shows all that winning the fight against poverty is achieveable in our lifetime. some kids are needed to help with chors, such as fetching water and wood. that is so mean if they make the children do that. by the end of the day the kids didn't have enough enery because they cdn't have food."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3383	1	i think that they convinced me that they can win the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because they said that bed net has chemicals that last for five years and keeps malarial away. their is also some other cheap medicines that can get rid of malarial too. the kids in kenya are always making do with what they got too.	5	4		0	4	4	4																		
3388	1	"yes, because reading this seems to make people want to help i think that by him talking about the way they have no clean water and food and school i think people will go there and help and give money and help buil schools and hopitals also so we can stop and get better healf and make this place no longer poor. this will get a lote of people to help and save people from dieing. but then i say no because you have no ideal of how long this migh take people hear donÕt have money to give away also this might take up to 100 years just to get clean water. so i think it is yes and no. there two side of reading this story/book"	3	3		0	4	3	4

3398	1	"yes this author convince me about putting people out of poverty because the millennium villages project in sauri, kenya are trying to help the people of sauri by sending them supplies such as school supplies, water, medicine. but there goal is a very long one because they aim for the year 2015 but the goal is worth it since they are helping people out of poverty. in the year 2008 the school had its supplies for school and the hospital had its mechine supplies and with running water and electricity. the people of sauri had nets to prevent mosquitoes spreading malaria to its people. but there next goal for poverty to end is year 2025."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3401	1	"i think that is important for kids in the united states to learn about people in kenya because we might want to help the people who live there to get a better education, help people if they are sick go to a good hospital so that we can care for them, make sure that alot of people are not going to die, and also make sure that people are not poor anymore so people are able to eat, go to hospitals and many more things."	3	4		0	3	3	3																		
3409	1	"the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because from 2004-2008 they have already solved a preventable but deadly disease called malaria. this convinces me because over 20,000 kids die from this disease everyday. i wouldnÕt want to be one of them. here is an improvement of the disease from 2004 to 2008: bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. (a bed net is something that can prevent mosquitos because mosquitos carry malarial. also you can catch it when a mosquito bits you. another issue they have solved is school fees, and less school supplies. for school supplies they have given the students and teachers more tools to work with. also, now in kenya they have let the students go to school for free. this is convincing to me because if i did know all the things i know now, i would probably have never gotten this far. the last issue is enough food for everyone in kenya. this is convincing me to help them because i wouldnÕt survive with any food. they have solved this problem because because they make sure that everyone getÕs enough food. when i read this i thought that i wasnÕt living good. e last issue is enough food for everyone in khehh"	3	4		2	3	4	3																		
3416	1	"kenya: past and present when i read this selection i was so devastated about kenya, it made me want to help as well. one reason i wanted to help was, that in the past the students in kenya couldnÕt go to school because they couldnÕt afford school fees. also, the bed nets, which help prevent malaria diseases, cost $5 and people didnÕt have money to buy it. last, in the schools they had minimal supplies like books, and pencils and also didnÕt have a midday meal so the kids didnÕt have any energy after school. now, in kenya they donÕt have any school fees and bed nets are used for every sleeping site. hospitals have running water and electricity and medicine. the hunger crisis was addressed with fertilizer and seeds, and tools to maintain food supply. lastly, in the schools they serve lunch to the students so now the attendance rate is way up. in conclusion, kenya needed alot of help and they got it because of hannah sachs, the author of this selection. now kenya is a better place to live in than before."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3418	1	"i think that the author thinks that kenya is a very poverty area. it is important for the u.s kids to learn about kenya because i think it teaches them not to waste things because in kenya kids are starving, dying to learn. learning about kenyaÕs before and after the millenium village project would teach the u.s kids a lot. examples about kenya before the millenium village project: one example is that the yala-sub district hospital was not in good shape because the hospital had no water connected or no electricity. second example is that there parents can not afford the school fees but the children want to study. third example is that farmers cannot afford the necessary of the fertilizer and irrigation. there crops were dying. examples about kenya after the millenium village project: one example is that today the yala-sub district hospital has medicine, free for charge plus water is connected and there is a genarator for electricity. second example is the hungry crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools to maintain the supplies. third example is that there are no school fees, and now the school serves lunch for the students. i think that making places better like kenya will make people lives better."	5	5		2	4	4	4

3434	1	"kerr_020019430 i think yes because people who feel bad for poor people. i know that some people who want to be rich are greedy. but if they look from the poorsÕ perspective. they could possibly:have some sympathy. some people who had been poor but got back  on their feet. would most likely help. if the rich actually thought, Òif i didnÕt go to school. i wouldnÕt be educated and would want moneyÓ then they would care. even though the people who are average wouldnÕt care as much, they can donate their old things. my family is average and we had a pile of old baby clothes. we knew that there was an organization named Òsalvation armyÓ that accepts donations. my family cleaned our house to look for things to donate. after 4 bags of baby clothes. we drove to salvation army. they took our bags and said thank you. salvation army is a good donation place, because it helps the poor. people who donÕt want old things can just donate. it can help one poor person at a time. people in sauri, who are poor and canÕt afford medicare,can die quickly. it would effect the whole population if they didnÕt have medicine to cure their sickness. in the u.s, we have the right kind of medicine to prevent our illness. but people in sauri are suffering. the yala-sub district is a good place like the salvation army. everywhere in the u.s, people advertise to ask for donations and food to give to the poor. those people are the same as salvation army and the hospital. i think that it is possible to help the poor."	2	2		0	3	3	3

3446	1	"yes, winning the fight against poverty is achievable. many people have begun to help those that have problems with providing for their families, they just havent completed it yet. sauri is an example. in the story when it begun, she described sauriÕs hospital as a place with little room, no electricity, no water, no doctors and not enough medicine. this doesnÕt look like our hospitals, does it? if our hospitals can be so nice, theirs can be too. 4 years later their hospitals have electricity, water and free medicine for the most common diseases. one step closer to winning. next, they have to solve the hunger problem. before, farmers crops kept dying because they didnÕt have fertilizer and couldnÕt get proper irrigation. this caused his family to not have enough food and no crops for the other villagers. with the help of the millenium villages project, they now have ferilizer and water. weÕre halfway there. finally, what are they going to do with the schools? first of all, the families couldnÕt pay the fees. second, there wasnÕt an abundant supply of materials. lastly, the kids couldnÕt concentrate without lunch. but now they have solved it, the school is free, and there is lunch. weÕre still not quite finished. see now? look what became of sauri in 4 years. it is possible to fight poverty. all you have to do is believe and help contribute. if we can have a better society, why canÕt they?"	4	3		3	4	3	4																		
3447	1	"yes, i think she did convince me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. this article said a lot of things why kenya was not doing so well. the people had very little money. or no money.  alot of deseases. a big one is malarial, mosquitoes carry it. bed nets that have chemicals in it are very helpful to keep the mosquitoes away but they were five dollars. people couldnÕt afford them. there are some cheap medicines but still twenty thousand kids die from deseases every day. school is also a tough thing. they donÕt get much supples so they donÕt get that much edjecation. also kids donÕt get lunch so they donÕt have much energy. some people cant even afford school. last is farms. farmers canÕt get great fertilizer so crops cant grow. all of these problems were a big deal and they needed a change.  they made goals for 2015 and 2025. but things are already going well. thatÕs an achiement. the author said great things that are happening now. the nets for mosquitoes are now affordable. and the hospital is free. it now has water and electricity. now less kids are dieing. the schools have better and more supplies. they now have lunch and its free! now kids can get an edjecation. farms can now get good fertilizer and crops can grow so they can have food. as you can see itÕs becoming better and people are not dieing. itÕs not compleatly better but its good we can also help. the author really convinced me that this is achievable."	4	3		2	4	4	4																		
3448	1	"i think that winning against poverty is achievable, because by doing your best, donating, and helping people with proverty can decrease the chance of poverty winning. as the author said, within 4 years sauri already got a lot better! before, in 2004, crops would die because farmers couldnÕt afford the necessary fertalizer, many people would die from diseases like malaria because nither they couldnÕt afford it, or the hospital jst doesnÕt have the medecine to treat it. and also, many kids couldnÕt go to school because there were school fees, and since there were no lunch at school, kids would starve and have no energy left at the end of school. but with the help of the millenium villages project in 4 years, a lot have changed! hospitals would treat you for free, there would be water and a generator for electricity. there would also be free lunch at school, no school fees so many students could learn and not starve. farmers could also afford their fertilizer to grow crops. so therefore, winning against poverty is possible!!"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3453	1	"yes the author did convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achivable in our lifetimeÓ because in the text in the subtitle Òa better lifeÓ it talks about people making progress. and that now in the text it said that there are no more school fees, and that schools serve lunches know for students and the attendance rate is up, also that water is connected to hospitals which generate electricity, and also that bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri. also the hunger crisis has been addresed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. i think that this project was worth it."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3455	1	a way that this can be inproved is by saving the money. that they have to buy. an bed net that cost 5$. they get 1$ each day so i f they save up to 5$ they could get that 1 and that will help them a lot. because it will protect them. another way that would help them. is by saving more money to also by bed. there isnÕt a nuf space for them. itÕs 3 children to alittle bed about the size when you go to the hospital or ethier there is 2 adults to a bed. also they sould save money to buy to get cleaning supplies. they need cleaing supplies so that. it wont be dirty. that can help them a lot because no one would get sick and cuase death. they need jobs because they have to have money inoder to do this stuff it is very good for them to have goals that thay are cabel of achiving.	3	4		1	3	3	3																		
3463	1	"i think itÕs true because you can do any thing if you put your mind to it and do your very best. the author did her very best to help the people in the millennium village of sauri, kenya. she helped on this project to help the people and it took a very long time for the project to complete but she still helped anyway and it helped the people in kenya too. the author saw how the citizens in the kenya village looked like and she felt really sad and a need to help them. i bet anyone will help if they have the heart to. we can also win the fight against proverty if we all work together. one person fighting canÕt win. we all need to work together. when people work together, itÕs much more faster and easier. as the quote says Òtwo heads are better than one.Ó sure one person can make a huge different and change but itÕs people together that that makes a bigger and more huge diffenece and change."	3	3		0	4	4	4																		
3467	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable because in 2008 the hospital started having more medicine.  they got water that was connected to the hospital, bed nets that were used in every sleeping site, people were less hungry because they got fertilizer and seeds to grow food.  there were no school fees, and the school served lunch for all the students."	4	4		1	4	4	4

3483	1	"i think winning the fight against poverty can be achievable if the people trying to rid the world of poverty try really hard and really give this project an effort. but first, these people should probably raise awareness of poverty and tell all the more privelaged countries about poverty. i really do think winning the fight against poverty is achievable. by 2008, sauri got so much help from the millenium development goals. if you were to take a quick peek at the paragraph in the article on the previous page(s), you would see a subheading entitled Òa better life-2008.Ó in this section, you would read about the yala-sub district hospital giving its patients free medicines that treat more Òcommon diseases.Ó the hospital also gets water and has a generator that generates electricity. and, school is free and provides lunch! all sleeping sites have bed nets that keep away malaria infected mosquitoes. and, to banish the hunger that inhabitants of sauri face, the millenium development goals provided them with fertilizer, seeds, and utilities to make sure their food supply is stable. yes, i think that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime,Ó because the author is probably only about twenty. so she has a long time left here. unless she gets into an accident."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3486	1	"no, i think that winning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime, because a lot of people won't try to come help and to supply money and water for the rest of their lives. i think some people might not help, because they might complain about mosquito bites, and the weather, because kenya is close to the equator, so it will be vert hot there. if 20,000 kids die each day, and they try to help them, in a week it will be more 100,000 kids dying in kenya each week. if kenya wants to become more successful, then they will need more helpers. they need a lot more helpers because they only earn less than a dollar a day. they also need medicines, but it will take them a long time for the people in kenya to save up to 5 dollars. the author did not convince me because 20,000 kids die each year, people in kenya earn less that an dollar a day, many kids can't attend school, and they don't have enough money to get fertilizer. so, if more people help they can unite together to form a team so, it they don't set more goals and acheive it by 2025, it will be a lot of poverty around kenya and it will probaly be more than 30,000 kids dying each day. the helpers can't be there everyday when kids die, so if they don't get enough shelter, water, food, and hospitals, some children might not make it to their twenty's. if the children moms and dads made it to an old age, the kids should, too. all they have to do, is to use the same strategies back in the day (i don't know what the strategy is) to survive longer and healthier."	1	1		1	3	3	3																		
3491	1	"kenya: before and after i think that it is important for kids in the united states to learn about how life was like in kenya before the project. so does the author but iÕll explain it with 3 examples. my first reason is that kids did not get a free education. since the parents of most of the kids could not afford the school fees, the kids could not get an education. by the way, the schools had minimal supplies and there were no midday meals so the children would come home with no energy and an empty belly. but because of the millenium villages project, kids could have a free education, a midday meal, and more supplies. my second reason is that there were a lack of good health and sanitation. there had to be 3 kids to 1 bed and 2 adults to 1 bed in a hospital, plus, nobody could afford the fees. also, there was no running water or electricity and there was no doctor but a clinical officer. the millenium villages project changed everything because water was connected to the hospital, there was a generator for electricity, and medicine was free. my third and last reason is that there was a lack of water, fertilizer and seeds. when they planted the seeds, they would have no water or fertilizer for the plants which unfortunetly made the crops die. which mean that there would be no food for the family to eat and made them starve. the millenium villages project however, gave the farmers fertilizers, seeds, and tools. as you can see, the millenium villages changed the lives of many kenyan people such as free education, better health, and better farming."	2	2		2	2	2	2

3502	1	yes winning the fight aganist poverty is achevement because they need food and they need hospital money for the medecne. they need skool fees so the kids can go to school and get an education they also need ferlizter so they could grow crops and get the food they need! they need to get provided with nets for the miscatoes because of they donÕt the hospital doesnt have money to get the medication for the care. they get the money from the people around the world.	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3504	1	"winning the fight against poverty might be acaeptabale to help people until they die it can be a better life to cure people to afford schools, getting medicine free of charge, and to prevent disease by using supplies. the project what it really take is the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good. the progress is encouraging people to supporters of the millienium project for solutions to the problems that people keep imporvished. the hunger crisis had been addressed with fertirlizer and seeds as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. water is used  connected to the hospital, which also has a generator of electricity that can help people from kenya to try to change their lives together."	4	4		1	3	3	3																		
3510	1	i'm convinced that winning the fight against poverty is achivable in a lifetime. in my opinion she persuades me very well because she says things about how much they improved because of this project. for example how the auhour talks about her coming back to kenya in 2008 when she was 16 and says they have a hospital called the yala-sub district hospital were they have the medicine hat cures the common diseases and they hospital has clean water and a generator that generaerts electricity for the hospital. also she talks about how the children have a good schoowl and are feed in a good envirenment. another great thing that tey ow have is the bed net in every living envirenment. they have seeds and fertiller hat help them grow plants so they can survive and how everyone is living happier.	3	3		2	2	2	2																		
3517	1	"yes, the author did convince me. i say yes because, many things that have to do with poverty are being fixed right now. this poverty problem is not only in kenya, it is in many other places. these places are also getting help.  in the text there were examples  that also helped me make this decision. for example, they set a time limit for this project, which shows a attitude and certain confidence that we can help them overcome poverty. another example, is that they started the project! this is one less country that needs help overcoming poverty, which may lead to more people trying to help out . another example is that the people of sauri have made amazing progress. they have gotten supplies for farming, school, and even medicines at the hospitals in about 4 years. one last example is the dramatic changes in over 80 villages in sauri. the death rate is down, the attendance rate for school is up, hospitals have water and electricity, and much more. these are all examples of overcoming poverty. so, i do believe the author convienced me that we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime."	2	2		2	4	2	4																		
3520	1	"yes, because the patients in the hospital are spreading diseasing to the kids & adults in the room. in the heading Òthe fight for better healthÓ the author said kids has preventable diseases & they are near death. my opinion, i think somebody need to do something about it quick before the kids die, the kids parents are very sad of this. i would be too. the author convince me to fight against poverty again because we need to help the children before something happensÉ.."	4	3		0	4	2	4																		
3523	1	"i think kids in the united states should learn about how life was like in kenya before and after the millenuim villages project because it lets kids know that people in other countries donÕt have the same opportunities that americans have, but these countries can be helped. there was a place in africa called sauri, kenya. in sauri there were some major problems. for example most kdis in africa canÕt go to school because parents canÕt pay school fees, but the oneÕs that do go donÕt have lunch. in america almost every kid goes to school and schools serve lunch. in the hospitals there werenÕt enough beds, no electricity or running water, no treatment and no doctors. in america patients get the treatment they need. americans can even get medication from drugstores, some people donÕt even need to go to the hospital to get treatment. one disease that sauri had a problem with was malaria. malaria was out of control. people get malaria from mosquitos who bite them. people canÕt get malaria if they have bed nets. bed nets only cost five dollars, but most people canÕt afford bed nets. when adults get malaria they just get sick. when kids get malaria they can die. many people can afford bed nets in america. in america we donÕt have a big problem with malaria like sauri does. these problems have been solved. for schools the mellenuim village project have made school fees. free and schools serve lunches now. for hospitals the treatment is free of charge and electricity generators and water are connected to the hospital. for that malaria problem the millenium villages project has gotten the people of sauri, kenya bed nets. this is why i think kids in the united states should learn about the mellenium villages project in sauri, kenya, africa."	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3540	1	"i think that the author convinced people that winning the fight againist proverty is achievable in our lifetime because kenya was very poor. they had hispitals that were not in good shape. there was three kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed. the rooms were packed with patients that probably didnt recieve treatment, there was no runnng water or electricity. they also had a diease called malaria which is common but preventable and treatable. mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. they had chemicals for it but each net cost $5. their crops were dying because they could not afford necsarry fertilzater and irrigation. but now hospitals have medicans free of charge for common dieases, with running water and electricity. bed nets are used in every sleeping site in suari, and the hunger crisis has been solved with fertilzer and seeds as well the tools needed to help with the food supplies"	3	3		2	3	3	3																		
3542	1	do you know how the poor people feel? do you feel sorry for them? in my opinion i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our life if everyone help each other. on the other hand if might not be achievable. i think poverty is achievable when everyone works hard. for example if the rich people are willing to donate money to the poor or people with high income should pay more taxes. i think that if they donate money to hospital and school in africa then people wouldnÕt die as fast. kids would get good education. if we word hard i think we could achieve the goal because the millennium villages achieved they goal. Òthe people of suri have amazing progress in just four yearÓ. one the other hand i think poverty is not achievable because if the rich people are selfish and are not willing to donate money to the poor then more people going to die or become sick. Òthere was no doctor only a clinical officer running the hospitalÓ. if there were no doctor they are no point of going to the hospital because they wouldnÕt get their treatment. i think people should donate money to the poor in africa. a lot of people die because they donÕt have money to care for their sickness i think we should create more club or even to donate money for the poor.	4	4		0	3	3	3																		
3544	1	"yes you can get rid of poverty because if they can get a job and make money. or someone can raise money for them so they can get lunch for their school. or they can go hunting for food to save up their money so they can buy different types of food or you can just still save and keep on eating the same hunting food such as, deer food, cook a squirrel all types of meat. to get rid of poverty you can find some clean water for grow some plants so you can be healthy. but you have to clean all the water, build a well, all that takes time so you have to wait about 2-3 years. or you can pick a person to get them horses so they can travel to different places. (move) or someone can go over there and pay them for working for him or donate some money every week such as $20 dollars through $60 dollars, and they can also donate some fresh food and water or electronics and cars, that would be very helpful for them. they can get/buy more medicine for the people who needs it really bad or they can ship the money and buckets of water, food, animals, plants, electronics, and also free cars and money and also vehicles, pets, all types of things they need, and they can get them new clothes instead of torn, raggity clothes. or they can make hunting gear like the indians and they can buy more furtilizer for their plants such as trees or they can pick up all there trash to save their environment and i think its not fair for them because we have all the good stuff and all the food and stuff and they have nothing, or they can make beds, and blankets so the misquitoes wonÕt bite them or nothing and build homes where they can stay at."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3547	1	"i think that the people in sauri need better schools and school supplies. i think they need better materials to make the schools, like if they use wood and bamboo, they school up grade to bricks and cement. the schools also need better materials to work with. for example. they need high quality pencils so they won't break, they also some sharpeners so if pencils do break they can sharpen they and get their work done. they might need better tables and chairs so the kids won't get spinters from the lower quality tables and chairs. the people in sauri did not have good quality things and schools 2004, but jut after 4 years, in 2008, they got better materials and schools as i said earlier. during 2004, they didn't have enough money to go to school. farmers didn't enough fertilizer. now in 2008 they pretty much improved on all of these things. i also think that the people need more bed nets to prevent the younger generation to die. later in 2008 they got enough so that they made enough bed nets for all the villages."	4	4		2	3	3	3																		
3558	1	"they didnt have alot of money for medicine for people when they are sick, they didn't have hospitals and lunch for kids to eat. but then go to for yours later they had hospitals lunch for the kids to eat the school didn't have fees. and the hospitals had any type of medison for desices and sickness and bed nets were used their. many kids in sauri did not atend school because they could not aford the school fees."	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
3561	1	"based on this article the author has convinced me that winning the fight against poverty is achievable because many places are being improved in kenya, like homes, schools, and hospitals. since the millennium village started to help people in kenya many things are being accomplished in order to get people out of poverty. one of their achivements is that the millennium villages has improved hospitals and schools by giving better lunches and by giving people the attention they need. many schools in kenya have been given supplies for students. this will help children with their studies because they will have materials to use and they will be able to learn what they need. also, their will be no school fee's for the kids in kenya. this is perfect because many kids will no be looking for wood and something to eat. not having to pay school fee's allows children to go to school and to learn. when the kids had to pay school fee's, they didn't go to school because they could not afford it. many hospitals have been improved too. now, hospitals have water and electricity to keep the hospital running. also, the hospitals have medicins for the patients. this helps because now people have an opportunity to stay alive and to be in a good enviorment. another thing that is helping are the bed nets that everyone have. now mosquitos don't bite them and they can be healthy. if everyone helps the millennium village, kenya won't be in poverty and every will have what they need. poverty will be illimanated in kenya y 2015 or 2025."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3564	1	"yes because peoplein other countries like the u.s, can help give sauri, kenya money for what they need. we can help give out supplies that are needed. we can also help each other out for what we need. the people of suair, kenya needs to stop charging fees because really nobody has money that can pay fees. if they do sauri, kenya will still be poor. nobody will be able to learn. people in sauri, kenya can also tribute to by helping too. we all have to help or sauri, kenya will stay the same."	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3569	1	"the aurthor did convience me because before they did not have water, and electricity in hospitals. some kids could not go to school because their parents couldnÕt pay for them. but then in 2008 in hospital they had food and electricity for their pactients. also the world should work togather to fight agast inproverty. also that many kids were dying becuase of malaria. not many kids and adults have bed nets because they are poor. but now school serves lunch."	3	3		1	4	4	4																		
3573	1	"121601y3_ 000514663 yes, the author did convince me to fight against poverty because i think that people should always have the money to get school for their children and to provide food for them at school. but in 2004 there were a lot of struggles and troubles that i read in the paragraphs. tattered clothing, no energy after school, people in hospitals suffering from illnesses. but eversince 2008, things have been going perfectly because sauri got food, electricity, water. i;m actually glad that sauri got everything they needed to have a good and healthy life that they have now. poverty is a bad thing to me and i am against it im just happy they got better things in their hospitals so people wonÕt die. and the bed net can prevent mosquitoÕs from biting people so they wonÕt get the disease called malaria. and poverty is achievable in our lives because if we work hard to end poverty there will be less poor people in countries and more people would have homes and food and money. and why we should do it is because most countries donÕt have running water and electricity, most hospitals arenÕt working, children donÕt get to have the education they want and need, the crops and plants arenÕt growing so well which are making people starve in saui, kenya and in other countries. poverty is in a lot of places and they need help including money, they need working water and electricity. they need more clothes. but it got better in the future because they got everything they needed 4 years later which helped them succeed in their life which helped people in the hospital have better health from the water and electricity. and less people got malaria by them getting bed nets, the crops grew better because they got fertilizer and what they needed to make people full again and didnÕt have to worry if their children will go sick. and the yala sub-district hospital improved, midday lunch has been served at school and the children have energy now. the beds have all been covered with bed nets all over sauri, kenya."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
3579	1	"yes, because anything is possible if you work together. it might be hard and it might take a long time but when the right time comes it will be worth it. it is achievable in our lifetime because we have medicine, stuff to protect us, water, electricity, and other useful stuff. the author also said that people with bed nets can save their lives but it will cost $5 so people will have to give people jobs so they can earn money to buy bed nets. another reason why winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that people who get sick can go to the hospitals to get medicine but it would also take alot of time to make. lastly, the hunger problem can be solved if the materials needed could be free so crops can be made and it could feed millions of people so people wont starve to death. mainly to solve the problem there should not be charges. thatÕs why winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime is very possible with hard work."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3584	1	"yes, the author did convince me that Òwinning the war against poverty is acheiveable in our lifetimeÓ, beacause in 2004 many people did not have bed nets. then in 2008 every sleeping site had a bed net. which lowered the amount of people sick with malaria. if the amount of sick lowered it allows hospitals more space for more serious dieseases. that is only one tramatic improvment. another improvement that effected my opinion is at first schools didnÕt serve lunch. then in 2008 the schools had lunch. which made the kids more foucused and make them achieve bigger and better goals. when someone achieveÕs bigger, and better goals, they receive better payment. better payment can help you and your family servive. the last improvement i want to talk about is having water. in 2004 hospitals and families had no or very little running water. in 2004 hospitals and families had no or very little running water. in just four years to 2008 almost every family or hospital had running water. which helps people live a better, cleaner, and healthier lifestyle. so if we keep this up we will make the world free of poverty. so yes, the author did convince me that we can make a difference in the world. if we all understand what others are going through, they would care. now, if we all pitch in we can end poverty forever. the world is dying! letÕs help it!"	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3587	1	"to me poverty is a really bad thing, i think Òwinning the fight against povertyÓ is achievable in our lifetime because they started back in 2004 and they have made big changes, like making schools have no school fee and more books, that made the school rate go up. also they are helping farmers get more fertilizer. i think that we need to have the africans get jobs that pay them desent moneys so people can get health care. i do think we will achieve the goal."	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
3593	1	proverty is a very bad thing but in the usa even the poor/low class citizens sometimes donÕt even have proverty. but it still happens in some parts of the world like kenya. i really think if they work hard to they can succend. the first reason that the kenyians are in proverty is that there crops will die at a good chance. they have to bet on if they will have food or not for this year. if this group help irrigate the crops and treat the crops with the right material they might have food to eat and maybe sell to others. they might even make enough money to pay the stuff back. the seacond reason i have is the diseases that is in kenya. it is a very treatable diseases if the treat it and have a good hospital in every city the population might start to grow. if there is more people maybe just maybe theyÕll be farmer or builder to get more food and build better roads. the third reason i belive in them is that now they have free education. the kids might aswally learn something and help the community. sence the hospitals help the population go up there might be	4	4		2	3	4	3																		
3595	1	"i belive that we can win the fight against poverty in one life time. well think about not only kenya but about other contries as well as the medicine they has a few but with the project it changed kenya that could be the same of other countries dealing with poverty. another idea would be that they needed mosquito nets since they had many mosquitos but now they all have nets that can not only improve kenya but the rest of africa or south america or any contry who needs it as well as ear farming they had no water or fertilizer or electricity that changed think of countries that have no water, no fertilizer or electricity how will they be able to live. we need to think about not only ourselves but other human beings. we shouldn't want to but things. but we should be giving things away that is how people who made charities were probably thinking about. ""we are a link in amida's golden chain that stretches around the world"" the quote was a teaching explaining that we are all human beings reguardless of race or color we are all one and is all equal to one another"	4	4		0	4	4	4																		
3599	1	"i feel that i am convinced. i do belive that if we supply and help the local lords we can help establishing an actual ÒcountryÓ in saur kenya. my example of this is Òvillages get technical advice and practical items such as fertilizer, medicine and school supplies. local leaders take it from there.Ó i am very sad that 20,000 kids die every day, and i am happy that we have helped sauri get medicine for it. my example of this is Òthe solutions are simple yet 20,000 kids die each day from the disease.Ó"	3	3		0	2	2	2																		
3602	1	i think the author did give a convincing argument that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because people started off all sick but someone had made medicine for the people who lived there. some people created goals to not get sick.	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
3604	1	"based on the test i think it is achievable. in Òthe fight of better healthÓ she says that they couldnÕt afford a medicine 5 dollars and they are close to death. they also state in the text that their hospitals is not in the greatest condition. kids donÕt have food to eat and schools arenÕt good. in Òa better lifeÓ she says that bed nets are used to stop the diseases that are spreading. also, they look better than they did in 2004 when they didnÕt have the bed nets. their hospital is fuller. they have a water generator thatÕs connected to the hospital, also they have electricity. they already improved. they have fertilizer and seeds do farming is good. lunches are served at school. she also states that the attendance is up. they have food and energy in Òa better life-2008Ó it states all the improvements. so i believe that they can conquer proverty. so they can achieve it; it is achievable. hard work, but you could make it. based on my understanding anything is achievable with hard work, and prayer."	3	3		2	2	2	2																		
3605	1	yes is achivable to win the fight against poverty in our lifetime.  one reason is that in kenya only live for $1 a day.  also in kenya the hospitals didnÕt have running water or electrictiy to run machiens for treatment and the hospitails couldnÕt aford giving the pacients food.  even many kids didnÕt attend to school because there parents couldnÕt afford the school fees.  i infer all theses probles will get a reward for all the persons that didnÕt lost faith.  i also infer that these people were strong and didnÕt lost faith in rough times.	3	5		1	3	4	3

3615	1	"no the author did not convince me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ. first of all if there are 80 more villages and we only covered one village in the past 4 years. itÕs going to take a lot longer each time. because the u.s is running out of money them selfs. also if they get every bed in every village as a bed net that cost $5.00 each that money really starts to pile up. plus cures to diseases to cost a lot of money and some diseases spread so a lot of people will need cures. if there are over 79 villages to cover that the country doesnÕt have. the united states will have to help, but we have too much debt too pay off. plus if it took 4 years for that village, it already been another 4 years. therefore it will take longer each time if we are not in a good position ourself. also if bed nets cost $5, medicine would probably cost like $10 each, and so much other expinsive stuff per family. plus there are a lot of family memebers in each village. so people may not relize it but that is a lot of money."	4	4		0	3	3	3																		
3620	1	"this is because she wants that kind of poverty to be a thing of history. also she wants the kids to realize how kenya was very poor and did not have much food or water. then, the hospitalÕs did not have any electricity or running water. next how they dressed with torn clothes and no shoes. after the millennium villages project all of this changed. there is medicine to treat the people when they are hurt or sick. also there is electricity and flowing water for the hospitalÕs. also water for the crops. there are no school fees and schoolÕs have food for the students. they also have fertilizers for the plants to grow. bed nets are now in every sleeping site in sauri. the attendance rate is way up. i infer that the people that are in sauri are very happy because they have the food, water, and other supplies they need."	4	5		1	4	4	4

3644	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our lifetime? the 2 sides are yes we can win the fight against poverty and no we canÕt win the fight against poverty. this issue is important because 50% of the world population live on $2.50 or less a day. my opinion is yes we can win the fight against poverty. first of all, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because eighty villages in sub-saharan africa have made amazing progress in just 4 years. some people may say that only 80 villages have made progress in just 4 years. i disagree with this statement because the number of villages that gained progress could have been less. the people of villages that gained progress could have been less. the people of sauri, africa now has free medicine at the yala sub-district hospital which proves that it made progress because before, the hospital didnÕt have treatment to diseases. another piece of evidence that proves that sauri made progress is that schools there now have enough school supplies. four years before 2008, schools in sauri had minimal supplies like books, paper, and pencils. second of all, winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime because the hunger crisis in sauri has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds,, as well as the tools needed the food supply. some people may say that the farmers in sauri will run out of fertilizer and seeds. i disagree with this statement because the millennium villages project could give more fertilizer and seeds if the farmers in sauri run out of them. the farmers in sauri got fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply which proves that sauri made progress because before, the farmers couldnÕt afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. another piece of evidence that proves that sauri made progress is that the hunger crisis has been addressed, but before, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. we can win the fight against poverty. eighty villages in sauri have made amazing progress in just 4 years. the hunger crisis in sauri has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply. we can improve this situation by working together to improve life in sauri. for example, people can contribute by donating money to sauri."	4	4		3	4	4	4																		
3646	1	"yes, the author did convince me that winning the fight against proverty is achievable in our lifetime. i say this because seeing and hearing about how the people of sauri, kenya, live on less than a $1 a day is sad. in sauri there are alot of common diseases. the most common disease is malaria. something that mosquitos carry and when they bite people the disease goes to the human. to  prevent this people use bed nets. bed nets only cost $5. but because people of sauri live on less than $1 a day they can't afford it. in sauri not alot of people go to school. either they can't afford it or they are needed at home for chores. when children attend school it's hard for them to concetrate because they have no midday meal. they also don't have much school supplies. knowing all this makes me realise how many things i have and what i should be greatful for. i got to the store and spend $2 on slim jims, and gum, and candy. something they can't do. so i do believe that we can win the fight against proverty."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
3659	1	"the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetimeÓ because at first it said the people in sauri had to function on less than one dollar a day, many people got sick with malaria & other deseases to die and they couldnÕt give the children at school lunch. but now it says that in just 4 years the people have improved. they have better health care with bed nets and medicine to cure deseases, they have water and electricity for better health. sauri people even have seeds for growing crops to eat. plus that helped the hunger crisis to go down. the article even said Ò80 villages across sub-saharan africaÓ have had dramatic changes. also it showed how the millenium village project helped to do all of this so that the people would have a higher population, less poverty, more food, less sickness and with a little more help we could make an even more gigantic difference and possibly end poverty all together. and if we end poverty all together we can have more people alive and well than the people alive and well than the people that are sickly and have no food and/or homeless. reading this article gives you hope and although we can never really completely wipe out hunger, we can do our share to make sure that we do what we can to have less and less hunger in the world."	3	2		2	3	3	3																		
3665	1	"yes, hannah sachs did convince me.  she wants to support or help the milliennium village in sauri, kenya.  her goal to finish all of this is 2015 or some other targets set for 2025.  the plan is to get people out of poverty they followed the village leaders into yala sub-district hospital, it wasÕnt in good shape.  there wasÕnt electricity or water.  there wernÕt any doctors just one clinical oficer. their crops were dying because they couldnÕt afford to buy the nessary fertalizer.  a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of the lack of fertalizer. they wont have any food to come home to and the kids will go hungry. 20,000 kids die every day due to mosqutios with malaria.  a bed net could prevent that from happening over night but people can not afford it.  each net cost $5$! kids could not attend school becouse parents couldnat affored the supplies.  some kids help with chores and fetch water and fire wood.  there was no miday meal so the kids did not have energy."	3	4		0	3	4	3																		
3667	1	i think that i would have to agree because the people there made a lot of progress in the last four years. they made progress by getting the medicine they needed to cure the malarial. also they had bed net to cover most of the beds in all sauri. also they had the schools have no fees. but another thing is that they had a generator for electricity. also the people from sauri had no hospital charges and the kids in the schools there could now have lunch and have energy by the end of the day. thatÕs why i was convinced by the author that wining the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. but if you compare these achievments that the sauri people did here copared to how they were before you would like living here better. if you want to know why it is because before 2008 they were in a painful situation. in sauri before 2008 people didnÕt have bed nets all over sauri. kids there didnÕt have lunch. nor did adults and kids have medicine to cure malarial. also they hospitals in sauri didnÕt have generators for electricity. but the worst thing is that the farmerÕs crops were dying because they didnÕt have any fertillizers. so thatÕs why i agree with the author.	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
3668	1	"i choose yes, because we wonÕt know unless we try. one example that supports my answer is when they start talking about the sad parts then the happy part. because it support my answer that it tells you that when there are problem you can change it and make it better. they made plans to help the villagers from poverty. it shows that to never give up and think of special ways to help the poor village called sauri. the second example the convince me to say yes is when she mention the people who were dieing because sickness. it makes me want to believen harder that we can bring the the village better. there are many people who were sick no food and really really poor. those people also have little cloving. some people got infected by mosquito bites. we need to donate medicine money clothing and more. the third example is there a lot of poor, sad people. i donÕt like people being sad and have a bad life. it makes me worry a lot and makes me want to help them. people sit in the dust selling some supplies of food witch means they need money to by medicine, and more. the fourth examples is when people crops are dieing, no water, and electricity. people eat dead crops in sauri because they donÕt have water transportations. the soil have no nutrients. i donÕt like that. i want them to have steady supplies. especially before winter. the part that makes me really sad and wish it can stop is when people in sauri villages die everyday. then there will be a shortage of people. so i wish the people who are planing a plan to help have to hurry. i wish luck to the villagers and planners."	4	4		0	4	4	4

3695	1	"i doubt that it is possible to win the fight against poverty.  there are many ways the fight could fail. examples include:  loss of money prices rising, &c. &c.  however, the biggest one is corruption. loss of money could dramatically change the outcome of the fight.  once people see that the cities are fine, they will stop supporting.  or, people will see less progress, day after day, month after month, &c. &c.  once people see the loss of progress they will begin to doubt they can win the fight.  as the doubt grows bigger, more people will stop supporting.  if there are less supporters, there will be a loss of money.  the cycle will start over again. prices are another variable that can change the outcome of the fight.  if prices rise, there will be a shortage of money.  if there is a shortage of money, there will be doubts.  as i said before, the cycle of losing money will continue. now, the biggest change of the outcome is corruption.  the people who organized the project will die.  new people will take over.  if the new people are corrupt, they will use the money for their own selfish needs.  if they use a little bit of money, greed will take over.  after some time, greed will have its its effect, and there will be absolutely $0 to give to the poor. as i already said, there are many reasons that the fight against poverty could fail.  the first is loss of money.  the second is the rising of prices.  the biggest reason, is corruption.  however, if none of these happen, the project might be a sucess."	3	3		0	2	3	2

3847	1	"i was convinced by the author that we can win the fight against poverty in our lifetime. one reason is because under the sub-heading Òthe fight for better healthÓ they showed that preventable sickness was not treated because it could not be afforded. organizations such as the millenium villages project would be able to buy the bed nets that keep mosquitoes away and give patients the cheap medicine so that a preventable disease such as malaria will be able to prevent or cure malaria. this shows that diseases like this all around the world can be prevented or treated and lessen the poverty. in the third paragraph under Òa brighter futureÓ the article says that the project will assure these people health care which will let them spend less money on medicine and eliminate alot of sickness. the second reason i was convinced was because of the second paragraph under the sub-heading Òwater, fertilizer, knowledgeÓ. this paragraph stated that the kids did not have many materials they did not get a mid-day meal but they still worked hard to get an education. this convinced me because if they still work hard to get an education when they are older they will be able to make money and help out their homeland. the third reason i was convinced that we could eliminate poverty is because of paragraph 3 under the sub-heading Òa brighter futureÓ. this paragraph states that the plan of the millennium villages project was to get people out of poverty, assure them access to health care, stabilize the economy and provide villages with supplies. i believe this will help get rid of poverty because if more people join in to help with this project it extend throughout the world and help even more people in poverty by providing them with the supplies they will need to stabilize the economy and quality of life. the fourth reason is the one that impacted me the most. the whole section titled Òa better lifeÓ shows the changes that were made to the village of sauri. the hospital now has water, electricity & medicine. bed nets are used in every sleeping sight in sauri. the hunger crisis has been addressed by providing them with the tools to maintain the food supply such as fertilizer. there are no school fees and now serve lunch. this has made the attendance rate increase. all of this shows me that dramatic changes can be made to poverty across the world by using projects such as the millenium villages project. these are the reasons why i was convinced by the author that we can achieve our goal and win the fight against poverty."	4	5		3	4	4	4																		
3849	1	"i think that the taskes can be achievable in our life time because if they do get everything they need & work hard they will get what they need. there are 3 examples that i can tell you, 1 example is that their hospital had many patients so by 2008 the people of sauri had medication for the common sickness. ex. 2 is where the farmers didn't grow eough food for their family, & some kids didn't go to school but the kids who did go to school"	4	4		0	4	4	4

3883	1	"during a lifetime of poverty, i think that being able to win the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime, with the help from people around you, and the support from places around the world, because of the strength of how many supporters and helpers you have trying to fight against numerous poverty situations. as it describes in the article, the milenium village of sauri, kenya, from a village of full poverty to a well-organized and good economic place of well-trained and healthy people. this explains that being able to fight the world of poverty is possible and achievable. the millenium villages project was a project that was metioned in the article. this project was supposed to help, or support, villages who were poor and in poverty to be help themselves up to be a more economic, wealthy, healthy, and safe place. the plan, as said in the beggining of the article, was to assure them access to healthcare and help villages stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. the villages would get techical advice and practical items such as fertilizer, medicine, and school supplies. this plan would work for villages after time, to let the villages grow stronger and evolve. at the village of sauri in kenya, this plan had seemed to work. people were becoming wealthier, more and more kids had gone to school, and the village was stabilizing and growing into an economy."	1	1		0	1	1	1																		
3885	1	"i believe that poverty is combatable in an average lifespan. although it is extremely unlikely that a immense problem will be solved in approximately 70-80 years. i believe that poverty in sauri and other poor places will be more suitable for human life, considering sauriÕs amazing improvement in 4 years, which is relatively small compared to a humanÕs average lifespan. poverty can abolished if other problems can be solved and disappear, but problems seem to appear more than go away. destruction is simpler than creation, i believe that poverty can be dealt away with if we have perfect or near perfect conditions. also  natural problems such as global warming and shortages are not the only problem. human evils such as greed can cause people to commit crimes more and more, which will just end up not helping poverty. i believe evil cannot be held back forever, and the same with good. poverty may disappear for a while but it will come back in some way. poverty can also be in different forms. country-wide poverty is more focused on than local poverty. local poverty is another problem, although it is not as extreme. because of that it is less focused on. i believe poverty can be kept at bay for a while; maybe for a long time. but then, inevitably, a disaster will come along and destroy it all, or it will just slope downward. i believe that poverty can be crushed to near non-existency, but it will find its way back into the world."	3	3		0	4	4	4																		
3888	1	"do you think we can put an end to poverty? well i do. here some examples of why i think putting an end to poverty in my lifetime is acheivable if we follow millenium's lead. that i got from a story about a villages called millenium. which was once a village with not very many crops, very little school kids, your average pay was one dollar a day, and in hospitals their were three kids in a bed and not much medicine. milennium has now improved it's hospitals and that only took 4 years. they improved the hospitals by having more medicine, ant not charging to have to go to a hospital. this will help people get a job in millenium instead of being sick all the time. if we put our minds to it we can help people get a chance to get a job. millenium has also improved it's schools with more school suplies and zeroe fees to go to school. now their is more children attending schools in millenium. if we have more schools like this in the rest of the world, people will know more. there from people will have more jobs. this is just one easy way to stop poverty. suprisingly even good fertilizer makes a difference. the reason is because fertilzer helps the plants grow so the people in millenium will have more food. we can also give people more fertilizer. just one simple step"	5	4		2	4	4	4																		
3889	1	"i think that winning the fight is possible because there are many people who wish to help and assist in this project. in the last aparagraph, the author had written that the people of sauri, kenya, had made a big change in just four years. supplies have been given to villages in need, and water, electricity, and medical supplies have now been integrated into their hospitals. changes have occured in 80 villages across sub-saharan affrica. schools now serve lunch to children, hospitals can treat the ill, and people now have food to eat and ways of preventing mosquits from biting. farmers can now never worry about starving again; with seeds and farm tools, there will be more than enough food for everyone. if things have already improved this much by now, think of the success project millenium villages will have in 2015, or even 2025. some goals are hard to achieve, but with the right resources, and enough helping hands, success is at hand."	4	4		1	4	4	4

4012	1	"yes, because the author gave many examples. one of them was about health. people in the hospital never really got the treatment they needed. also kids and adults get sick from malaria every day. this could all be avodid with more medical supplies and $5 nets. the author also talked about farming. farmers didn't have water. not only the farmers ,but the people of sauri too. they needed clean, runing water. this could also be avodid if clean water was transported to sauri. another issue is food. people didn't get the vitamins they needed and grew weak. the education was also a problem as well. however, over the years, these problems were solved. the hospital now has medical supplies and running water. bed nets are now commonly used in sauri. the hunger problem was solved with fertilizer seeds, and tools needed for food. there are no school fees so children can learn for free. after all these problems were solved in a matter of 4 years, i think we can solve poverty for good."	4	3		2	4	4	4																		
4017	1	"i think that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. because according to the milennium villages project, there has been astonishing progress during 2004-2008. the yala-sub district hospital, which used to have a shortage of medicine, water, doctors, etc, now has free medicine that can treat many common diseases, so that even poor people can take it. the hospital also has water and electricity now, which is a big improvement from before. malaria, for instance, is a very common disease in africa, from which around 20,000 kids die from everyday. malaria is caused by mosquitoes, and to prevent the mosquitoes from coming & biting you, you can obtain a bed net. bed nets used to be too pricey, but today, every sleeping site uses them! now people can be safe from malaria. another huge improvement were the farmersÕ crops. the food was withering and dying because the farmers werenÕt able to afford good fertilizer & irrigation. now though, the project has provided them with fertilizer and seeds, along with tools to keep the food plentiful. another big part of life is education. in 2004, a majority of children didnÕt attend school, either because their families couldnÕt afford it, or the children were at home tied up with chores and familuy responsibilities. in 4 years, the have become free (no cost) for everyone to attend, and they even serve lunch! now the majority of children do go to school and get a good education. all because of the milennium villages project, the residents of sauri, africa now have a much better life than they did years ago. which means the project did achieve their goal. and that just further proves that winning the fight against poverty is definetely achievable in our lifetime. especially if youÕre going to have a long, hardworking lifetime."	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
4024	1	"i belive that is not possible becuuse there are too many countries to cover sure they helped this city but you are talking about every place that has poverty. you would have to raise a lot of money. it is hard to give a school that is free lunch and the school is free. all school need a white board, a few desk, books, and other basic school suplies money doesnÕt fall from the sky. hospital also need money for medicine, beds fore the people to rest on and food for people who stay for long time. the need tools for surgery. i can see what the author is saying but it just cost too much money, especialy the electricity. the generator in just one building costs alot already, but in every building i donÕt see it."	1	1		2	1	1	1																		
4027	1	"the article that hanna sachs wrote called Óa brighter futureÓ is about a 17 year old girl and her dad going to sauri, kenya which is in africa and seeing how people live there and how there is a lot of poverty. also she helps out the millennium villages project to get people out of poverty and stabilize their economy. i think we can win the fight against poverty. keep reading my essay and i would give you reasons why i think that. one reason why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that, first of all they are many people working on it. so if we all work together, then anything is possible. one example of what i am talking about is in the article, hanna sachs points out that in just four years, the people in sauri have made amazing progress just by working together and finding a solution. another reason why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable is that we shouldnÕt give up. what i mean by that is we shouldnÕt give up even if we keep failing, sooner or later we will get it right. one example of that is in the article, the millennium villages project wants their goals to be met by 2015. their goals are to get people out of poverty, help to stabilize their economy and quality of life in their communities. i am sure if their goals are not met by 2015, they wouldnÕt give up on it until they achieve it. some people might argue that by helping one country get out of poverty, we are putting another country into poverty. i disagree on that because if we all chip in something then no country will be in poverty. but one problem that we have is that. i donÕt think many people have heard about sauri, kenya so i think if people are more informed about what is going on, they will be more than gladly to help fight against poverty. like i said before, i think we can win the fight against poverty. if we all work together and never give up, then anything possible. and if we all chip in just a little that will become a lot and it will help the people in sauri, kenya. i am aware that kenya is not the only country that is poor. but i think we should take this fight step by step. i also think the millennium villages projectÕs goals could be met by 2015. these are my reasons why i think winning the fight against poverty is achievable. thank you for reading and i am sure this is possible."	4	3		1	3	4	3																		
4028	1	"yes. i agree with the author that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. in just four years, the people of sauri had made amazing progress. for example, the people of sauri doesnÕt have enough water, food and education in their daily lives. that can be a big problem for their health. but when we all work together, the problem can be solved. donating food and money for them can be one example of solving their problem. another example is that even in their tough situation, kids still want to learn. but without midday meals, they wouldnÕt have the energy at the end of the day. learning is an important part of our daily lives. so that is why i agree with the author."	5	4		1	4	4	4																		
4030	1	"yes, the author already convinced me that winning the war against poverty is achievable. because if the millennium village can make that much of a change in only 4 years, i wonder if the progress will double or even triple before we hit 2015. these are some examples the author used to convince my with, ""the yab sub-district hospital has medicine, free of all charge, for all of the most common diseases."" here is another one ""the hunger crisis has been addressed with fertilizer and seeds, as well as the tools needed to maintain the food supply."" here is the 3rd one ""there are no school fees, and the schools are now serving lunch to the students."" and here is my favorite ""bed nets are used in every sleeping site in sauri."" this makes me so, so happy!! do you know what this means? less people are dieing, more kids can go to school, more people are getting feed and more people are getting addtional care at the hospital. so that is way the author convinced me. i can't wait to know wait is going to happen in 2015!!"	3	3		1	3	3	3																		
4034	1	"is winning the fight against poverty achievable in our life time? this is important because they want to know if it is possible to stop poverty. stopping poverty is a good thing. its important because everybody can go to school and there would be less poor people. what of there is not enough supplies. if there is not enough supplies then they can share. even if they donÕt want to share they can at least learn. the kids need to go to school or they canÕt learn anything. the kids need to learn how to read and write. so they can have a little education. yea, but they donÕt need to waste money and let the parents teach them. what of the parents donÕt know how to read and write other then what do they do. it is very important that farmers can grow their crops. its important because they have to feed their families. if they canÕt grow crops then they will lose money too. then get the fertilizers while they still have money. yea, but if they canÕt grow crops then they canÕt make money. it is very important that this goal is achievable because there is lot of people that need help out there. some people that are dieing have a family so if they die then their family would be in trouble. also if no one helps stop poverty then maybe that whole village can get wiped out. so it is very important that poverty can be stopped. there is only about 200-250 people in the village. so that number can be easily wiped out by poverty. even if one person doesnÕt help then a person might die. so pretty much what we are asking is to help stop poverty so we can achieve our goal. if we wore the ones that needed help and no one helped us think about how we would fee. one way to improve this situation is to go to each house and ask them to help stop poverty."	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
4039	1	"the author had convinced me to believe Òwinning the fight against poverty is acheivable in our lifetime.Óbefore, the people in kenya could not afford hospital fees, fertilizer, school fees, and bed nets. they were poor; the only recieved a dollar a day. the millennium villages project decided to help that. today, school in kenya costs no money. hospitals have running water, electricity, medicine, and cost no money. every house owns a bed net and farmers finally have fertillizer. this proves that poverty can be helped. like the author side, the world needs to pitch in and help the poor towns and cities, so the world can be a better place."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
4045	1	"yes, because they convinced me that people don't have enouhg money to buy things they need to survive. they don't have enough money to keep them away from diseases. also, they are even struggling to get water, electricity, and houses. this article made me think that everyone can win. some people can't survive as long as others. they struggle to find food and water. they have to survive on fertilizer and if they don't have the kids will get sick. also, people had less that $1 to survive from diseases. some people struggle on surviving from diseases. such as, maleria mosquitos. workers made bed nes so epopel can be safe. but it cost $5, and some do not have that much money. it is harder because their houses could not have windows so the mosquitos can get in. if the poverty can get more money, they can get bed nets, and they can save millions of lives."	3	3		1	4	4	4																		
4050	1	"the purpose of this essay is to identiy the author's opinion on the mission of ending poverty between the years 2004-2015. a 12 year-old girl by the name of hannah sachs went to kenya with her father in 2004. there; she was discovering how the people in kenya were living and in what conditions they were in. she saw that many people had no food, no education and were really sick. if people in the village wanted food, water, clothing ect.they had to pay for it. even their education. when hannah sache says that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime; i think she means that if all of us work together as in our commuity and people around us, work together to give money, clothes, food, ect. and help them with stuff that they need."	2	2		0	3	2	3																		
4053	1	"i think that mvp was succssfull ,but they still need to think about later on in life when they have to do more and more. because it took 4 years to start changing sauri, kenya, but next time it might take longer. even though that they helped change run down hospital to better hospital with electricity and medicine, school with no lunch and not alot of students to school lunch periods and more students, and malaria being common to more people with bed net for preventing marlaria. they still need to think about the future to how their going to keep paying for things ,and more people to volunteer. because things might go back to being run down, and not good enough to support people in sauri, kenya."	4	3		2	3	3	3																		
4055	1	"i think he did convice me that wining the fight against proverty is achievable because proverty is bad and i donÕt think anyone should get put through proverty. in the text its aid the plan is to get people out of proverty assure them access to health care and help them. also, i think that means that there going to try to stop proverty. also, in our lifetime the percentage of homeless people and proverty is very high. also, in the text it said they are making a treatment for malaria because that a disease. and in the hospital beds there is 3 kids to a bed and 2 adults to a bed then you could imagin that itÕs a lot of people in the hospital and they is trying to stop it."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
4066	1	yes because it said in the text they need school supplies. they need fertilizer to help grow the plants. they really need school supplies to get knolwge. they get litte of breack fast each morning. they can never eat lunch at school. they need medicn as to get the cur is it cost 5 $ for the cur. they need water and food and mony. they use hold to go to the bathroom not a toliet.	3	3		1	2	2	2																		
4073	1	hannah did make a good point about us trying to fight poverty. like for example acsess to health care is good because if you end up getting sick it you won't have a doctor but if only we could send like a couple of 24 doctors to africa can help them. people need help so they can keep make a beeter life for the little kids. more education could be important for the kids in africa to be getting the right care. malaria can spread from person to person the only way you can't get it is if you get a bed that protects you at night from the diseas. people can't afford the beds because it is $5 and they useally only ern $1 a day. so if we could all just put are heads together then we can all get the supplies we need to help africa and everyone who lives there to get all they need to servive and have a good future. africa had no clean water so to make sure they get some we can start to send some from the u.s.a all the way to where they are and they can get all the water and electity they need. so the people can have air conditionor in the summer.  schooling for the kids is realy important because the kids need the egducation they can get so they can be what they want to be and set goals in life. medican will be needed so if someone get sick and the decid to be a doctor they could be able to help them out. so if we all just put are heads together and help one another we can acomplish are tasck to be able to help them.	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
4074	1	"yes, the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."" i think the author convinced me that because in the article, it said that sauri, kenya is very poor and can only afford so many things. so, i think that even though sauri is improving, they still need our support. also, children can now go to school for free because not alot of people could afford it. i think that going to school for free is a good idea because kids need the education and they get to have lunch at school too so they arn't out of energy at the end of the day. another example i think the author convinced me this is because people who lived in sauri that had to go hospitals, had to share a room with at least 1 or 2 people. the hospitals also didn't have water, electricity, or a docotor. now, sauri has electricity and water at the hospitals. last, sauri had mosquitos that bit people and could've kid them or have gotten them very sick. nobody could afford bed nets. now, they have out bed nets for free so people could live. that's why it convinced me."	4	4		2	4	4	4																		
4077	1	yes i think the author convincee beause he told that. they don't have enough meony to buy food colthes and soff. they do not eat every day. they only get 30 dollars a month to live. they survive with 1 dollar a day. in 2015 they will have more soff. they been doing better every year. there metting most of there goals. but more peopel are haveing disese and dieing everyday.	3	3		0	3	3	3																		
4088	1	"the purpose of this paper is to give a example of the quality of life in sauri, kenya, then improved why the life was unfair in sauri, kenya. sauri kenya is in the untied nation's in africa. they treated unfairly because the didn't have the stuff we have now. also because the resources they haved before got taken away from country's that were more powerful. i will prove that the life their was unfair and find 4 examples that explain why the saying of the author convinced me. sauri is a very poor country in africa. for example: the hospital had to put 2 or 3 children per each bed. two or three adult's had to go on each bed as well. maybe it's because the people couldn't afford better treatment's or the hospital couldn't afford more beds. that's just unfair, those people are poverty. which means poor people having little or no money. the sauri people so poor, i'll repeat there were so poor they couldn't afford any type of techology. they couldn't afford oven's, microwave, they probably would afford to buy clothes. they also couldn't afford houses, they built houses out of wood or stick's. they had to use the old way, that people very long time ago used, nature. they probably asked for the u.s.a for help. there was one problem, the u.s.a only helps with political problem. meaning if you want us to help you, what are you giving us in return. like when israeli asked u.s.a for help they denied their response. sauri didn't have anything to give them, so the u.s.a didn't help them. sauri is a poor country. their were poverty. meaing little or no money. the millennium village is doing a project to help them. the sauri can have the stuff we have."	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
4089	1	"yes, it is achievable to win the fight over poverty.  all we need to do is to help out.  not many people are rich but if we help, everyday kids wonÕt die of hunger and malaria. we can also lower the price in things the people need and give out free bed nets to people instead of having malaria and adults getting sick all the time. i also think that we should give more supplies for school and having no school fees.  without food not much people will have enough strength.  so thats why we should give them food and fertilizer for them to grow their food. i agree with hannah that we should all work together and change poverty-stricken areas for good. if theres very less hospitals we should build more hospitals and more doctors also the medicine for malaria-including electricity.  iÕm thinking,Ó how are they going to get electricity?Ó  some people donÕt even have money.  thatÕs why we should donate money.  all the things they need needs money.  that is what the things we need to do to win the fight over poverty.  working together helps to.  but helping everyone"	4	4		1	4	4	4																		
4098	1	"hannah sachs did prove that we can win this battle vs poverty in 2004 schools were not free and the schools did not have that many supplies. many children couldnÕt afford school there was no lunch. in 2008 schools were free and had materials. the farmers. in 2004 they had no fertilizers. in 2008 they had fertilizers and crops were not dying. hospitals in 2004 the hospitals did not have electricity and water. in 2008 people were had nets for protection from mosquitos. more people were going to school and schools had more materials the farmers corps was not dien. the project was good for africa because kids was not dien everyday i 2004 everyday 20,000 kids was dien. in 2008 people were not dien the hole neighborhood had a net. the hospital have free medicine bed nets are use in every site of saury"	3	3		2	3	3	3																		
4115	1	"yes because number 1 is because is what it would really is for the world to work together to change poverty-stricken areas for good number 2 is there are many solutions to the problems that keep people impoverished. the people of sauri have made amazing progress in just four years the yala sub-district hospital has medicine, free of charge for all of the most common diseases. water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electiricity. those were the examples i really liked this article its really nice to do what the millennium villages project i really would like to know what would happen in 2015 or 2025."	2	1		1	2	1	2																		
4128	1	"the author of ""a brighter future"" did convinced me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime. she convinced me that is possible by giving tons and tons of deatils about all the things that sauri, kenya needed so that the people could actually get out of poverty. they told me about all the diseases that are in africa. she told me now young children were not getting the education that is needed. she told so much about how the hospital was in bad shape. the hospital did not even have enough money to buy medicines to treat all the patients. they had 3 kids to 1 bed and 2 adults to 1 bed. they had no lights and no running water. worst of all they had no doctor only a clincal officer. the people in kenya did not even have $5 to buy a bed net to fight away the mosquitoes. the mostiquoes did carry a preventable/treatable disease called malaria. over 20,000 kids die from malaria per day. the bed ns could have actually saved millions of lives. in the year of 2008 that really showed me that it is possible to change people's lives in sauri, kenya. now 4 years later they have helped the hospital get medicines to cure sick patients. the hunger crisis have been addresed with fertilizers and seeds. there are no more school fees so children can go to school and actually eat a hot meal. i am so glad that the students in sauri kenya get the same priveledges as me. life in sauri kenya is so different than life in the usa. we have very little to no poverty. in some schools there are no fees. at the local hospitals there are millions of doctors. but now that the ""millennim village"" protects kenya they have life like us. that is why the author convinced me that there is a change that could help sauria, kenya."	4	4		3	4	4	4

4139	1	"yes, the author convinced me that Òwinning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.Ó the author convinced me by telling me the before and after of kenya. just like in 2004, many people only spent a dollar a day when every bed net to avoid mosquitoes was five dollars. in 2008, every sleeping site had a bed net for people to avoid malaria too. in 2004, school fees were too high for families to afford, making kids lose education. kids who had education did not have lunch. in 2008, they made a change by having no school fees and lunches for students, earning more education. free medication for most common diseases in 2008 has easily helped poverty, keeping people alive."	4	4		2	3	4	3																		
4142	1	"based on the article about sauri, kenya did convince me that ""winning the fight against poverty is achivable in our lifetime"" because in the article it talks about how the plan was to get them out of poverty to something better, to assure them access to health care and help them stabalize the economy and quality of lie in their community. i beleive it is achiveable becuse in 2008 the hospitala shad medicine, children had food, and children had an education with good school suppliles and they accomplished it. the children in sauri, kenya now that, t ome, have won the fight against poverty, they can finally be healthy, have strength, and not have a hunger crisis. now parents can afford school fees, books, paper, and pencils. now children and adults won't get stick because they have bed nets. i believe that if we had to fighit against poverty in this time now i think it would be achivable because we could send money for them to buy bed nets, foend for children and adults to eat, clothing so that they can be warm and cool whenever they need it. we could could fight and win against proverty by doing this. the medicine can help them if they have a problem in their body or if they are sick. now that the fight against proverty is finished th ehospital is free of charge for common diseases. to me the author convinced me that ""winning the fight against proverty in our lifetime"" is able to happen because now that the fight is over they can live a better life."	4	4		2	3	4	3																		
4153	1	"poverty awareness from this article, i have learned that the fight against poverty is achievable. this article that hannah sachs wrote convinced me that the people of sauri, kenya needs help. this project they are working on it called the Òmillenium village.Ó their plan is to get everyone out of poverty. in sauri, people live on less than a dollar a day, they also do not have a stable, working hospital or school. their goal is supposed to be reached in 2015 and other goals are to be reached by 2025. if kids and adults got sick from malaria, they could not go to the hospital. they could buy a bed net, which was only $5. again they could not afford it. the people of the project revicied this data in 2004. in 2008 the project was still forthcoming, but they improved the schools and hospitals. even though there is much more to do. therefore i believe that the fight against poverty is not only achievable, but has already begun."	3	3		3	3	3	3

There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it."	5	5		5	4	4	4

Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library.      Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all.       There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't.     So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4169	2	"Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4171	2	"Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.      If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.      Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.      When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.     These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4180	2	"I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves.   First, some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses. If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite. Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them. It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people.   Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel home bond the more they will come.   Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too. If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock.   In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it. somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin.

4195	2	"There are many forms of entertainment in the world today.  Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio.  While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive.  When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive.  A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about.  There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.     The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon.  No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music.  If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it.  Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong.  There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people.  To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task.  Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries.  If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book.  The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it.     Everyone has a different view on things.  Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different.  This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people.  For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on.  This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy.  If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it.  Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong.  There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public.  People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it.  If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one.  No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to.  Also, the book @MONTH1 be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong."	4	4		4	4	4	4

Now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. None would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it.

4213	2	"Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another?    Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth.    Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know.    How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man.    In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4214	2	"People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information.     Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it.     Children in libraries should be supervized. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. @CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnacy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children.      Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get thier friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children.     Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervized. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4217	2	"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away."	6	6		6	4	4	4																		
4232	2	"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea."	4	4		4	3	3	3

Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday.

People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.     All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4256	2	I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say.      But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive.     Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading.      I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that.      This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all.     I really feel like am on both sides	3	3		3	3	3	3

Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt.  I mean think about it is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no.  Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that @CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean.  Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book or @CAPS1 it takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on @NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no, no @CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine.                                                                                                          @ORGANIZATION1"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4266	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,           I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4272	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed.     One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school.     Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion.     This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem.     Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4273	2	"Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate.       People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner.  If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate.  Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.  Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do.  Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention.  When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right.  People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard.      I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner.  Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive.     I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff. The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do)"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4277	2	"'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'.  Do these titles sound familiar? They should, beause these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications.  These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world.       When a child goes off to school ecah day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals.  But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right.  In all reality though, how is this helping anyone?     By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn.  By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think.  If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things.  When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual.       Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think.  By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think.  And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. How is that fair?      So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this.  Teach your children to be careful in what they read.  If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book.  Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4278	2	"Certain books should be removed from, the library because of the materials an  the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all.     The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things. Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library. They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures.     Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading. Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book.     Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them. Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies.     In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all. They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff."	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4281	2	"Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4283	2	"Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversey fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4284	2	"No I @CAPS1 not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason. Sure some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is gonna eventually here, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with."	2	2		2	1	2	1																		
4289	2	"As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?    I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.     Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4290	2	"Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?'                                               Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children.                                           'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did.                                                         There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life.               I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4298	2	"In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun. Some like to go to movies. Others perfer a nice walk through the park. Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want.          The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not. Its not fair to those who want to read it. I find it very dumb.     The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it. This is a very simple an straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it. If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it. Its just that easy.     The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read. Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny. If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off. If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs. Its not right and its not fair.          We should be able to read what ever we want. Its our right to read it. Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it. That is the way life works."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4299	2	"If you take offense to certian things, you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it. Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first.     Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended. You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future.     You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view. They both could have good ideas and functions to them.     Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them. Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad. Sometimes they can even make you stess a little.     If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them."	3	3		3	4	4	4

Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out.     The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it.     They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it.      Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult.     Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library.     So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do. Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4304	2	"In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4305	2	"Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either. There is music and magazines too. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books,  biographies, autobiographies, etc. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions.      There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and @MONTH1 need it for something they are doing. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book @MONTH1 be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book.      This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or @MONTH1 find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library.     A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier.      I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people @MONTH1 find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing. Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4310	2	I belive that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the united states of @LOCATION1 for there music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4315	2	"Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it. Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them. Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days. I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information. The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly. Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times invloving school. Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book. For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is. So why take that information away from me. Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from. Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4317	2	"I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them. we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.      As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television.     With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards. We all know about @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, but think about all of the magazines that we dont see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4323	2	"Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not? Many people have there own personal view on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc. that they themselves have purchased to get. Now they want them cenored? i don't think that is very right.          Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section. The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries.     Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something. Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4324	2	"I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4327	2	"I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad.@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad,but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though"	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4328	2	"No, the books and etc. should not be moved ,because anybody can be interested in them. Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them.      First, there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc. are coming in. Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff. That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come in the library looking for a book that they want. If that person can find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where. Then the library could start losing bussiness.     Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing. What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home. They can come do there research and rent books.     Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is there only place. Little children go to the library looking for books and etc. to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying. If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost. Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book.     In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc. should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4332	2	"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4334	2	"Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library? No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's.     I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read. I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids. Parents do the samething.      People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time. I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out. There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints.     Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before. People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal. Its not like they are watching anything bad. They mostly have kid movies not bad ones.     Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids? In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4338	2	"The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf .     I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive.     Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to.     On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person.      But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf. that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4340	2	"Censorship for the future kids of america.    Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie. That is how it should have always been."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4344	2	"In many @CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @MONTH1 find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     There is a reason that @CAPS1 libraries are called @CAPS1. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @CAPS1 library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' section of your library. For example: @PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' sections or even the '@CAPS3' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the @CAPS1. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big @CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4350	2	"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4358	2	"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want"	4	4		4	3	3	3

4371	2	"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion.     The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.      The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.      The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.      No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens"	4	4		4	4	4	4

4383	2	I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4389	2	"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4392	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4395	2	I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4403	2	"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4409	2	"Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea.      To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. @MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person?     There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever. Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways.     Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie. This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section.      In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4411	2	"The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4412	2	"READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4420	2	"It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor.     Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark.     Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned?     Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4426	2	"There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see. Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children. Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want. If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product.           Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is? Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit.     If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment.      There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4433	2	"Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4456	2	"Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive? Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that age group? Should them type of things but in the @CAPS1 with children? Should they be in @CAPS1's period?                                                                     I thing that the @CAPS1 should have all type of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books. But I also think the @CAPS1 should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at. Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes.                  The @CAPS1 should put people ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the @CAPS1. Because then you would no how old they are . And only @NUM1 years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes. But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it . And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for.           One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves because there are so people that comes to the @CAPS1 just to read them books. And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home.          I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the @CAPS1. Because it give me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1. And the thing's that was named make the @CAPS1 so fun an peaceful.  The @CAPS1 is a place were you can come and whine your day down.

4463	2	"Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines.

A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4470	2	"Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4473	2	"Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?        I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!           Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it.           Now that you read what  I had to say, what do yu think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4475	2	I dont think people should remove the books and movies and music cause its the peoples choice to read and listen and watch the things that that get.      Why should people change cause other people can't handle what the stuff has on it. If the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can its not other peoples choice.     The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. People will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too.     Like I said its the people who choose what they want to watch or listen or read and it is nobodies elses choice to say so. The people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they.     This is what i think of this essay it will be up to the people to choose what they want the listen and hear too.	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4478	2	"Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years.     Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races.     A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1.This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught.     Many other books exist as these. But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me.     There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4480	2	"When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.    One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.     The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.      The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.     Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4492	2	"Every we go there is censorship. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read.       Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from any thing we read.     There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic. If they read themselves they would learn alot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life.      It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent.     I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines. These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see. It should be up to the children what they read."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4494	2	"Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4497	2	"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4499	2	"I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no. I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive? Just ignore it.      I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.      People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict. It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?     I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4501	2	"When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from.  There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc.  But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing.  There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience.  The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake.     Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well.  For example, an explicit music album.  If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile.  By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in library's.  For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch.  Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate.  Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie.  This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch.  So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music.  There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book.  There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements.  By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.      For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed.  If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for.  Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4505	2	"Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library.     I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back.      I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4510	2	"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4516	2	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.     First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.     Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.     I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.     At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now	3	4		3	3	4	3

Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.

4526	2	"' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing.      I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds.

4534	2	"Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left!      If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the @CAPS1, some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the @CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the @CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library.     There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4536	2	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.

4538	2	"Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.       I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.      You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.      I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.     Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4544	2	"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need ."	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
4549	2	"What I belive is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book, is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries are sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there should'nt be a problem.      There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world, that is why there are so many differnt kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child. Yes it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by them selves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book.           Many children these days are getting bullied or pick on, and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child some where in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them.      You should stop and think if you was a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there is negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarassed of the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel.      Think about you opinion, does anyone care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trush? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion?"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4550	2	"Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it.     No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4552	2	"There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue.     On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it. @NUM2 which is parental guidance or @NUM3 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content.     I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves.      There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa.      That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4559	2	"As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but not all. I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote.     People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.      By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.      In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4563	2	"There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items.     One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents.     Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it. That decision, however, is up to the parents.     Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents.     There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4567	2	"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4568	2	"Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.     Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.     No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.     A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4570	2	"Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book, @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs.

Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some book that are offensive to some student, and if one student find something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelve. Many students like fiction books, which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him. School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life.      Music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library. Most common type of music that you can find in the library is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 music. Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry and bad words, racistism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not apporpriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library.      Movies are also carried in some library, but not every library carries a movie. Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be apporpriate for some childrens who are at school.

Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4585	2	"Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.

Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries"	3	4		3	3	4	3

Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf?     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't.     Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way.    There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it.     Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Even as we speak there might be a battle going on somewhere or somthing very importent is about to happen in other contrey. We will need this informaion all the time. There's this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You can not juge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it'. It took me awhile to understand what they mean't by that. Then, I finely understood what they really mean't. You can't juge someone by their outer looks, you must juge their inner personaltiy.When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you can not juge it until you see it for yourself. Compony people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love. Tv shows, newspapers, books, etc. All the things to make them happy.We must enjoy what we have in this life.

I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to every body, it would be brakeing the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them.     Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's there religion. It would just go to show that one mans garbage, is another mans tresher.     It would also be braking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech. It would silense all the great artist out there, trying to be herd. They should be able to write, sing, or film what ever they want. It is their right to do so.     That is the resion why they souldn't be removed from the shelves.

4601	2	"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4606	2	"I believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world.  I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what.     My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read. When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans. If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced. But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff. their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them. movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library. if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in. Music is passion to most people. most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that. their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again.     My point is if something comes off the shelf is should return to its rightful spot or otherwise their will be consequences and people will not be trusted much longer"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4609	2	"Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we want the truth and information in its rawest form.      Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural,spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information @MONTH1 be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the @CAPS3 or books to do with religion @MONTH1 be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage?     Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw.      Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4616	2	"I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship, it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them.     What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways.      I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That @CAPS1 just how people are and were.      Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual.     Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that @CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4618	2	"To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world.     Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear.     Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into. That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4621	2	"Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.

Books, magazines, music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination and as they grow or are thinking that its a right way to do things. All this things that are not for a proper use shoud be displade of were no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hust people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use.      Books magazines that have no material use and its used for pornagrafi or something else should be taken off shelfs. Kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Book magazines and music provide imspiration not to come to the fact that it comes to peoples distraction.thesse are way that by sometimes not knowing u hurt ur love one because of what u see, read or hear.this can the be the biggest effects on people.      The supplies you get like books, magazine, and music arent helping you and are caousing more problems in your life they should be take of markets. Also people sometimes decied to buy them beacause of what the pictures have instored for you in a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken of shelfs is the thought that u can get by looking and hearin and reading.This are all bad things for anybody to be ready or lisening to.     I belive that books, magazines and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it dosnt help you in any way. Also things that arent used for good are not use full.In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music sometimes it can take you to suiside or into making something cazy that later on you will regret.This is why nun od thoese things are use full for a person or a child     In conclusion, I think that books, magazines and music that are not use full shoul be taken of shelfs and should be putting things that do help the mind.Things that are not resorsful for a person mind should be put away.All this things came into not having estability in life and cometing rong steps that take you into failure.Finaly I think that all unresorsful books, magazines and music should be put away"	3	3		3	2	2	2

People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.

Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored. Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone ..

4640	2	"Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I dont think that is right. Thats just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library?   A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now?   Taking away music? kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it.   Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there.   So i think taking books, music, magazies, and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do. Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4644	2	"Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.

4647	2	"Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves.     Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them.      Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable. Teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library.      Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stoten from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library.     Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain material  such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4655	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No I do not. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it.     I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey. We can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you.      I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me. Or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true.     I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it. Because then things can get out of control.      That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries.

Somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people. Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.     Maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids. Maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world. The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence. That should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. The book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds. It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life.     I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts. These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directiors/ writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs.      Why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others? I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs. Let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset. I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself. If they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self."	4	4		4	3	4	3

4659	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4667	2	"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4669	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do believe so. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid see's a movie that involves violence.     One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive  because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occurr while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion, race, or anything that involves to there personal life. That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended.     Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie. Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what there kid's are watching. So it's important for them to learn and watch for there kids. In movie's anyone can  see a lot of bad thing that can effect anyone or can offend anyone. So I think that they should not have certain  movies on the  shelves that can harm or offend certain family or parents, espicially there kids.     Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that ocurr around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has soemthing bad inside. That's why they shouldnt have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn't buy certain type of magazines because they never know what there child can expect to see.          So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain book, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even my reading a book. It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themself that, before they read a book or see a movie. So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4676	2	"OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!!   Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now? They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not! The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things.       I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same. Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that! Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc.      I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all. Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !@NUM1"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4681	2	"I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4686	2	"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4695	2	"Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content?  In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people.  People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive.  Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.     People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines.  What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers.  There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children.  Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong.  Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries.  Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children.  Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.     An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone.  It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular.  How does this pertain to offensive books?  Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm.  Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose.  Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet.  Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns.  Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about.  The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.     Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book.  A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable.  Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read.  Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them.  Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been.  I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring.  Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.     There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today.  Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book.  Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others.  You have the choice not to read them or to read them.  Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1.  It does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times.     Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4710	2	"I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer. I personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake.     'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body. Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored. If your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this.     Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library. The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area.     libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you."	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4714	2	"I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it.            I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The book uses the '@CAPS3' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5.             From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life.             Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4715	2	"Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library.  In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left.  The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question.  There is a simple answer to this question.  It should not be censored.     Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize.  The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries.  As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.     To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works.  Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues.  These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.       The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with.  This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored.  The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line.  Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages?  In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind.  Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.     Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left.  This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone.  As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist.  It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4717	2	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave.          If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4718	2	"If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. @NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4722	2	"In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
4725	2	"Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs.      @CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4730	2	"Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You."	3	4		3	3	3	3

4742	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1     @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quit often, and things that I see in there I feel souldnt be in there. Like the movies. Theyre okay, but theyre all sitting together. So that means me bein a young lady. I see things that I know my mother wouldnt approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there.     I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them. Thats not right at all.     Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.         I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all.      Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What im just askin you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make there own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing and i kno many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children and a library with alot of censored things in there doesnt sound like the best. That just mean they are startin off wrong.                                              Sincerly: A student who believes in changes"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4750	2	There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books. Would you really want to take that from the people? If my arguement did' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4752	2	"Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  I believe that libraries should not have censorship.      I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4769	2	"I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4772	2	"Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies.  Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want.  Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children.  Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone.     Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life.  Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory.  Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else.  Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness.  Everyone finds something offensive.  Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter.  For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple.  Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range.     More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced.  Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading.  By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like.  This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4776	2	"I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching."	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
4777	2	"Different Then Everyone Else     @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive?My opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them.There are so many small things the can be offensive like books, movies, and music.Its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for thier one belonging.      Books can be a way to learned new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more then what can a person with there own words can.There are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids.I know the a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf  about '@CAPS2', when they are getting @CAPS2.Sure is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it.Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2?A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it,and you dont even have to talk about it.      Movies are similar like books,in one way the you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone.I know the some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Its a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to does people. And even it a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to belive it. A good way it to watch the movie and learned from it.      Music has  a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's thats their way of express their own feeling about stuff.We can't really discriminate anyone for their own belives. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, the use a lot of bad words in his song but thats how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you its more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinon then others.      My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music  about bad stuff don't assume I'm  going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it. Remember its your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
11842	5	" The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in."	2	2		2																					
11847	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, joyful, and loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, that made the author look up to them. The author even says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" After all a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Over all, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation."	4	3		4																					
11848	5	"In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others."	2	3		2																					
11851	5	"Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author it's a great mood unexplainable. in this article talks about a young man named @PERSON1 and how his life was from then and now. for example, on paragraph @NUM1, says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices. and how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.

By saying this @CAPS1 creates a warm calm mood inviting you (figuratively) into his home and childhood."	2	1		2																					
11904	5	"I think that the mood created by the author was happiness.

Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet.

The author says this because the authors parents loved him a lot they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was greatful for that. Now the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did ""parents created our traditional Cuban home"" also ""passed on to me the rich culonary skills and love for cooking"" and ""where I celebrated my first birthdays"".

11913	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time.

He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child.

""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."	2	2		2

The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Which @CAPS1 very compationate and full of emotion.Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parent were so willing to take in people that werent always blood related. for example in paragraph @NUM3, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Which States that they were very welcoming and accepting people.These are the moods the author created in this memoir."	4	4		4

""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" @CAPS1 you picture that in your mind you create a very warm, tasty, good-smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir. Another way Narciso creates mood is when @CAPS3 talks about the cuban music flowing @CAPS2 the house, ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" With this @CAPS3 shows that it was fun, warm, inviting, and exciting. @CAPS3 says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encommpassed, both, formed a backdrop, to life in our warm home."" @CAPS3 also creates a mood of fun, warm, entertaining, and loving feeling, by describing parties, celebrations, with friends and family, In This memoir, the author sets a mood of warm, loving, fun, and entertaining."	4	3		4

12001	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was like hapeness and he had a lot of emotion. Because he really loves his mother, and father and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about how he lives were he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment. The hapeness part is When he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home that was realy a happy and sad memory."	1	2		2																					
12003	5	"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful"	3	2		3																					
12009	5	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended it just made me think he was comfortable with his home."	2	2		2

""and for which I am eternally grateful"" ""I will always be grateful to my parents"" @CAPS1 like these that are scattered thro-ugh out the excerpt show greatfulness, and love for his parents. Some other @CAPS1 like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"". Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and community. One quote that can to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is ""It takes a village to raise a child"" I think thats how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors, they were family."	2	2		2																					
12023	5	"The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. They now have a bigger house. They are grateful they live in the United States."	1	1		1																					
12026	5	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""      The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close is friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community.       The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need.""       @CAPS1, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness."	2	2		2																					
12033	5	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her.

Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.""     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing."	3	2		3																					
12036	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is intresting. First of all, his parents ""originally from cuba but arrived in the united states in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty one years old Rawedia Maria and twenty seven year old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call home.

Thats how the mood is intresting from the author creation"	1	0		1																					
12037	5	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
12046	5	"The mood that was set in the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the mood that was created, by the author was to reflect on your life and to relive the great expierences that the author has gone through in his mind. It was just to think of all the great times the author had with your family."	1	0		1																					
12049	5	"The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. He also creates a mood of happiness, unity and overall loving, that he has seen throughout his lifetime. The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. When all of these details combined, along with language such as. ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."	3	4		4																					
12056	5	"In this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the Same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need"". This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood."	3	3		3																					
12062	5	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."	4	2		3

He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants.

12070	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
12079	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
12080	5	"I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love that everyone has for one another. Lastly the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family."	3	4		4																					
12090	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of ""family"" is. He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think."	3	4		4																					
12093	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2		2																					
12096	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1																					
12105	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a mood.

It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive.""

The mood the author created is very grateful."	4	4		4																					
12146	5	"The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching."	1	2		2																					
12151	5	"The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home.

12154	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger."	3	4		4

12243	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."	3	3		3																					
12244	5	"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times @CAPS1 had as a kid. @CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how @CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music. @CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home.  In the last line @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also talks about how @CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. @CAPS1 describes how even though the familys from different places had almost nothing in common they'll all became very close. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. Is happy in that memoir because @CAPS1 only revisits memories that @CAPS1 was fond of. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir."	4	4		4																					
12247	5	"As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them."	3	3		3																					
12250	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 is happy, @CAPS3 was happy that @CAPS3 got to live in @LOCATION2 and be raised in @LOCATION2.@CAPS3 happy because shes lived In the Same house in New Jersey all her life then finally got to meet her grandparents In 1970 When @CAPS3 turned @NUM1 years old.@CAPS3 Is also happy because @CAPS3 Is older and has alot of memorys In the house and Is happy @CAPS3 lives In a free country."	1	2		2																					
12258	5	The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives.	1	1		1																					
12265	5	In this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one. An example of how you might know this is in paragraph @NUM1 when it discribed what he loved doing with his parents and family. Also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends. One more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to @LOCATION1. There are some details of why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness	2	2		2																					
12267	5	"The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is. Narciso shows how greatful and proud she is that her parents would change cultures, language, and also find a new job so she could be born in @LOCATION1. The author also shows how close their family is. They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her."	2	2		2																					
12271	5	"The mood in the memoir is loving. It is loving because the authors parent's let pretty much anyone in need, come to live in their house. They did this because they knew if they were in need other people would do that for them."	1	1		1																					
12277	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. for his family and the people @CAPS1 him. Especially his parents who came to @LOCATION1 from cuba. And At first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. Love for his culture that came from cuba with the music and food. And most of all the place he had called home Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him."	2	1		2																					
12278	5	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you."	3	2		3																					
12283	5	"The way this author wrote this memoir, he @CAPS1 created multiple moods. The main mood he created was thankfulness. He continues on about how thankfull he is that his parents aborted their lives to make his life better. The author really emphasizes how thankful he is that his parents did this for him. Since his parents did this for him he has even become a clothing designer. The author of this memoir is very thankfull. This author also creates other moods such as happieness and sadness. This author creates many moods in this memoir."	1	2		2																					
12285	5	In the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selflessness his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another even though they werent the richest family they still stuck together. In paragraph @NUM1 it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting.	2	1		2

In conclusion @CAPS1 was very proud and thankful to his parents."	2	1		2																					
12292	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1		2

It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

12332	5	"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""	2	1		1

This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen.

My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.""

He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2		2

The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"".

12428	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey.

Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship."	2	2		2

There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful.

Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life.

12517	5	"The author's mood was happy, thankful, greatful, caring, thoughtful. The mood was happy because he was sharing his life story and what his parents did for him and his siblings made him very happy and greatful. He is very thankful because his parents could have stayed in Cuba and let them grow up there. But instead they came to @LOCATION1 and struggled at first, but the end result was more they could have imagined. He described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs. The author sounds like he is very thankful to grow up here than Cuba because he now sees that he had a much better life. Having a family liked he did he really cheriste the word family.

12523	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love"	3	2		3

12539	5	Narciso Rodriguez created a very positive mood throughout the memoir. The mood that was created by the other was happy. I chose this mood because in the memoir he describes how nice it was to live in a town where people cared for him.

In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the author created a very positive mood throughout the memoir.	2	1		2

""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso lists the facts about his childhood. The memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him. The powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness. The word he uses can tell they are from the heart, the memories of @CAPS1 parents as well as the rest of his family, influenced his life, and he learned the true meaning of family."	3	3		3

For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life.	2	2		2

Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is.

12580	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	3	1		1																					
12587	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."	2	3		3																					
12611	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1		2																					
12615	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2																					
12619	5	"One of the moods in the memoir was greatful. Narciso greatful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also he loved that his parents thought them so many things. I mean that he always had something to do. He was always happy to be around family and friends."	4	3		4																					
12633	5	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life.

This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him."	2	3		3																					
12638	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

This shows the emotions the author felt growing up."	2	2		2																					
12674	5	"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career.

""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."	3	2		3																					
12698	5	"The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2		3																					
12705	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2		2																					
12706	5	"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful."	4	4		4																					
12709	5	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
12710	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him. They didnt just tell her what to do, they showed her. When he talks about the @NUM2 lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live (the essentials to living).  They also showed him the meaning of family. He doesn't just think family is blood related, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of ""family"""" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is grateful.

12741	5	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story."	4	3		4

He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3		3

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life.

12794	5	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end.

In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees.""

Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why."	2	1		2

The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad.

Within the second paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez provided a sentence to generally describe his thoughts toward his three room apartment, claiming it to be where ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The adjectives that Rodriguez providvedes in the sentence, such as ""innocence"" and ""warm"" provide for a comforting feel, while ""congregation"" adds to the concept of the unity. However, he is also shows that his parents were very responsible and hardworking, coming to the United States ""selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers"".

The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner.

Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.	3	3		3

13530	5	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew.

This whole excerpt is thanking them. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much he loves them. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things. He could really call it home.In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gretfulness & loving.

13569	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family.In this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote shows the love and affection that Narciso Rodriguez feels about his parents and his home.After reading this memoir, that was the mood that was created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
13571	5	"The author creates a mood of joy and thankfulness in the memoir of how great life was and how grateful he is for what was given to him. The author writes about how even with the little they had how happy his house was with all the music and visitors that were mentioned in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Also the author portrays how thankful and grateful he is for everything he was taught, was sacrificed for him, and for the life lessons that were instilled in him. In paragraph @NUM3, the author writes how he learned that ""family"" wasn't only blood relatives but was all your friends that would always be there for you as you would be for them. The author also explains how grateful he is for everything his parents went through for him in paragraphs @NUM4 and @NUM5 giving mood of happiness and grateful ness. Narciso also creates a mood of love, as of that he had for his parents and ""family"" that he says transferred his house into a home in paragraph @NUM6."	3	3		3																					
13572	5	"The author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable. Here are the ways he creates it. He describes the kitchen and how his family loves to cook and entertain. He says that his parents have welcomed refugees to stay at the house that sets a welcomeing mood and that the parents care for their friends and family. To his family the word ""family"" means anyone it's important to remember that because a family could be anyone. That's how the author sets the mood."	2	2		2																					
13576	5	The mood is @CAPS1. The story talks about Cuban culture. He talks about all the @CAPS1 times. All the time he spent with his family celebrating cuban herritage. They would all come over for dinner. Thats how he set the mood.	1	1		1																					
13579	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happeness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, whitch shows how the mood is actually peaceful. In the memoir the author stated memeries of his neighborhood that was good. The authors stated about how the cultures formed together, helped each other and worked hard to make a living as well is a future for their kids, which shows his respect for his friends and family. The author states his gratitude toward the hard ships his parents went through for him and for the dream of a better tomorrow."	2	1		2																					
13590	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
13596	5	The mood the author created was how they were immagrants and they had to adjust the the @CAPS1 way of life but they still celebrated his first birthdays In that very house. They will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. It was deminstration of how important family and friends are. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.	1	2		2																					
13598	5	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The @CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home."	3	4		4																					
13604	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family""."	2	2		2																					
13606	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now."	3	3		3																					
13618	5	"Warmth                                                                                                                                            In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author created the mood in many ways.One way the author creates the mood is by saying (paragraph @NUM1) ""The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionat Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". (paragraph @NUM2)These are the ways of the author of ""Narciso @CAPS1"" created the mood in this story."	2	2		2																					
13626	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving caring child in the US. Also he was proud that even though his family moved to th US from Cuba he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with is culture by having family come over."" My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and RosemaryÉ regularly joined us at our table."" (ph @NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez family came to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso family gave up everything including leaving Cuba so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of."	2	3		3																					
13630	5	"The mood created @CAPS3 the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is Love and @CAPS2. Love is shown in this excerpt @CAPS3 how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about then. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done."" @CAPS2 is shown @CAPS3 the Way, Narciso described the house he grew up in. Stated in paragraph @NUM2 that ""Here, in innocence of childhood, the congregation the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Love and @CAPS2 is expressed all throughout this memoir and I stated just a few examples of it."	3	2		3																					
13631	5	"The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home."	2	2		2																					
8878	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1		1																					
8883	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time."	1	1		1																					
8884	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
8887	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they donÕt die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story."	2	1		2																					
8888	4	"In the story, ÒWinter HibiscusÓ, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, ÒWhen they came backÉthen I will take that test again.Ó because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, ÒI failed the test.Ó. We also do not know Òher gentle grandmotherÓ, Òmrs.LambertÓ, and ÒhomeÓ. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, Ówhen the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.Ó most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ ended with the specified paragraph."	1	2		2																					
8906	4	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. "	1	2		2																					
8907	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
8918	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test.

Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
8926	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
8940	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.Ó This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  "	2	2		2																					
8942	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
8949	4	"The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader Òif you just try, you might like it,Ó and thatÕs why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again."	0	0		0																					
8959	4	"In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didnÕt want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life."	3	2		3																					
8963	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you donÕt know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
8972	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home."	2	2		2																					
8986	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
8992	4	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and thatÕs why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
8993	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0		0

9004	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and wonÕt give up. ÒSaeng  vowed silently to herself, ÒI will take that test againÓ, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again."	2	3		3																					
9006	4	"I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece."	3	2		3																					
9007	4	"The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows SaengÕs willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, ÓWhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingÉÓ @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, ÒitÕs not like the kind we had before.Ó But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  "	2	2		2																					
9008	4	"The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she wonÕt give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning."	2	2		2																					
9012	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about.

Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon."	1	1		1																					
9015	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
9018	4	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license."	2	1		2																					
9029	4	"The author concludes the ending as ÒI will take that test againÓ meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express Òwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingÓ she is thinking of the feature and how she Òsaeng vowed silently to herself in the spring.

9034	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. Òalmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. ÒThis shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded."	2	2		2

By failing her driverÕs test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. ÒShe found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..Ó I believe that this is showing that she still didnÕt consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.

9039	4	"The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, ÒI will take that test again.Ó By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didnÕt say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, Òwhen they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way."	2	2		2

9046	4	"The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think heÕs trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant.

So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasnÕt full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, ÒIn the spring, when this hibiscus is buddingÓ The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesnÕt give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again.

The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do.

In the ending paragraph, the author writes, Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life.

When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass."	2	3		3

At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time.

9262	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0

This entire story deals with SaengÕs depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
9274	4	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.	2	1		2																					
9277	4	"If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be thatÕs from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always ÒhearÓ that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore thatÕs why he concluded the story as such. "	2	2		2																					
9280	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe itÕs because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
9281	4	"The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test ÔShe said, ÒIÐI failed the test.Ó By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start."	2	2		2																					
9284	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
9287	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states Òthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againÓ. It shows that even though she failed it once she isnÕt going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states Òwhen they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingÓ. It shows that she doesnÕt regret buying the hibiscus.

9295	4	"This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending.

9304	4	"The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test."	2	3		3																					
9308	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because itÕs a good conclution. ItÕs a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do.

Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."	2	2		2																					
9320	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9322	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she wantÕs to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
9325	4	"The author concluded the story ÒWinter Hibiscus Ò the way she did because she wanted to show saeng Ôs determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, Òshe was still too shaky to say the words at home Ò.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although sheÕd had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,ÓI failed the test Ò, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saengÕs determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in Òwinter HibiscusÓ is used to show saengÕs determination."	3	3		3																					
9329	4	"The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them."	3	3		3																					
9332	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2

In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
9341	4	"In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says ÒIts flowers arenÕt pretty, but itÕs strong enough to make it through the cold months.Ó This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In SaengÕs case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. "	3	3		3

9361	4	"In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant.

9406	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because sheÕs concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, Òthe winter hibiscus was in the ground now,É.Ó So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did."	0	0		0																					
9409	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ the story ends with saying Òin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againÓ The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change.

9426	4	"In Òwinter HibiscusÓ the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good."	2	2		2																					
9428	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldnÕt change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driverÕs test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,Ó I think Saeng didnÕt have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2		2

Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. SaengÕs mother states, ""ÉitÕs strong enough to make it through the cold monthsÉ. ThatÕs what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
9434	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
9445	4	"The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time .

9448	4	"This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test.

9460	4	"The author concludes the story with Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this ÒtestÓ and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with Òwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againÓ definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote."	2	2		2

9480	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
9482	4	"The author of ÒWinter HibiscusÓ concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againÓ because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes SaengÕs resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads ÒAnd besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.Ó This excerpt demonstrates SaengÕs love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news ÒI-I failed the testÓ @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is SaengÕs source of stength as itÕs the only thing she knows in the united states.

By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends.

9491	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
9492	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasnÕt it for the little girl and she wasnÕt going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didnÕt work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesnÕt work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0

9502	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1

This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does."	2	2		2																					
9513	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,Ó because it shows That Saeng isnÕt going to stay down.

9522	4	"The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway.

9533	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1		1

9552	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show SaengÕs determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when sheÕs in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, ÒIt was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.Ó"	2	2		2

9555	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again."	1	2		2																					
9560	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
9561	4	"In ÒWinter Hibiscus,Ó by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ÒÉin the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,Ó by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words."	2	2		2																					
9571	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, itÕs adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 SaengÕs thoughtÕs are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang SaengÔs eyes now and swept over her ÒandÓ in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.Ó This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because itÕs gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  Òand this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.Ó It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3

This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence."	1	2		2																					
9592	4	"The author concludes the story with ÒIn the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againÓ because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy."	0	0		0																					
9593	4	" I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad.

9597	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane.

9605	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1

However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. "	1	1		1																					
9618	4	"The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driverÕs test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, Òaware of loss so deep and strong that it stung SaengÕs eyes now swept over her. ÒThrough the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. ÒThe pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and SaengÕs mouth watered,Ó, ÒThe winter hibiscusÕ was in the ground nowÓ, and, Òoverhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and Ð yes Ð Familiar to Saeng now.Ó This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope.

9625	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,Ówhen the snows melt and the geese returnÓ this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, Òwhen this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.

After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express SaengÕs feelings to stay determined and take the test.

For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. SaengÕs situation is similar to the flowerÕs, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test.

Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesnÕt want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																					
9794	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says ÒIn the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test againÓ. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says Òwhen the snow melts and the geese return.Ó She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again.

When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, ÒSaeng didnÕt dare look her mother in the eye,Ó which shows SaengÕs concern for her motherÕs reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, ÒItÕs a beautiful plant, IÕm glad you got it,Ó which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship.

I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland.

She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings.

She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground."	3	3		3																					
9865	4	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them.

After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. "	2	2		2																					
9867	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak.

9868	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in.

9891	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																					
9897	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because itÕs  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and itÕs  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1		1

9927	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say Òat home.Ó When she says Òand this hibiscus is budding,Ó I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a ÒVÓ so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again."	3	3		3																					
9933	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																					
9938	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																					
9941	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																					
9943	4	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you donÕt know how good you have it.  	0	0		0																					
9954	4	"The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says ÒAnd beside it was yet another old friend.Ó She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did."	1	2		2																					
9961	4	"The final  paragraph in, Òwinter  hibiscus Óby @CAPS1  Ho reads  Ó When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.ÓThis paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home"	2	2		2																					
9962	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng.

Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
9965	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldnÕt believe it. She didnÕt want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again.

So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     "	2	3		3																					
9977	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
9986	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
10003	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
10016	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it itÕs winter and the hibiscus hasenÕt bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2

10021	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1		1

She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland.

10027	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. ItÕs just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. ThatÕs the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  "	2	2		2

In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing."	1	1		1																					
10056	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
10057	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
10059	4	"In the story Òthe Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example Òwhen the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test againÓ, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1

In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not Òat home,Ó that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alwayÕs  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her."	3	2		3																					
10078	4	"The author ofÓWinter Hibiscus Òuses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saengÔs future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driverÕs test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   "	2	2		2																					
10080	4	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said ÒI failed,Ó talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said Òits not like the one at home.Ó ThatÕs why the author concludes this paragraph."	1	1		1																					
10083	4	"In the short story, ÒWinter Hibiscus,Ó by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again.

Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. ÒWhere was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?Ó When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,"	0	0		0																					
10088	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isnÕt giving up when she brings home the flower to plant.

Also when she says, ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.Ó That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isnÕt giving up. Another example is when it says, ÒAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Ó Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it."	2	2		2																					
10098	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingÓ, she gains more confidence because she leds like sheÕs back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
10101	4	"The author of the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. ÒShe closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.Ó Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up SaengÕs despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, Òthen I will take that test again.Òyou can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,Óthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding,Ó and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security."	3	3		3																					
10102	4	"The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it."	1	0		1																					
10105	4	"I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,"	2	2		2																					
10120	4	"THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS ÒTHEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.Ó, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER.

After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again.

10141	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. ItÕs almost as though itÕs taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words Òat home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2		2																					
10143	4	"The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story."	1	1		1																					
10144	4	"The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again.

The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story."	2	2		2																					
10147	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say Òwhen they come backÓ talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting.

10156	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ, the author ends with the statement, Ò...then IÕll take the test again.Ó This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in.

She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldnÕt handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home."	1	1		1

She wasnÕt adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time.

She says, ÒAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Ó This shows that she is adjusting.

She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers Òlong gray hair, freshly washed ÉÓ But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again."	1	2		2																					
10282	4	I thank he uses it because she wants to get a nother one next year to see what its like to like something so much and get to look after it for a wial That is why I think the nararator use that phrase as his last one.	0	0		0

10293	4	"In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driverÕs test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says Òalmost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had becomeÓ This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes theyÕll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. "	3	2		3																					
10299	4	"The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant donÕt most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes."	1	1		1																					
10301	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you dinÕt know about."	0	0		0																					
10310	4	"In this story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, ÒWhen they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Ó In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test sheÕll be better prepared. "	1	1		1																					
10316	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10323	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese returnÓ. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
10343	4	"In ÒWinter HibiscusÓ the author @CAPS1 sentence is ÒWhen they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1																					
10346	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home."	1	1		1																					
10353	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
10354	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, ÒWhen they come backÉthen I will take that test again.Ó She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  "	2	2		2																					
10358	4	"The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard."	1	1		1																					
10360	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
10363	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10365	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
10368	4	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.	2	3		3																					
10370	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. ÒNot like the kind we had before Ò(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.	1	1		1																					
10382	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But sheÕll be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past."	1	2		2																					
10384	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring itÕs warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
10389	4	"The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didnÕt give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change."	2	1		2																					
10391	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time	1	1		1																					
10394	4	I think he means thas seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. 	0	0		0																					
10395	4	"I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome itÕs test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own."	2	3		3																					
10400	4	"The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back."	0	0		0																					
10402	4	"I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story ÒI failed the test,Ó and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test."	1	1		1																					
10406	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, ÒAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Ó @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar."	1	1		1																					
10420	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
10427	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."	1	2		2																					
10429	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. ÒShe lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...Ó the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. ÒAlmost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.Ó The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. ÒSaeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. Ô@CAPS1, Saeng said.Õ ÒAfter failing her driverÕs test, walking into the floristÕs shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  "	3	3		3																					
10434	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says ÒWhen they come backÓ she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. ÒIn the springÓ shows when the flower will come back. ÒWhen the snows melt and the geese returnÓ she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). ÒAnd this Hibiscus is buddingÓ She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. Ò Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
10435	4	"The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her."	1	0		1																					
10441	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
10454	4	"The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive."	0	0		0																					
10457	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.	1	1		1																					
10459	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
10461	4	"The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didnÕt have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test."	2	1		2																					
10464	4	"The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
10465	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, Òthrough the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, Òwhen the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
10466	4	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ.  "	1	2		2																					
10468	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driverÕs test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
10471	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus sheÕll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																					
10474	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. natureÕs fight for survival is like SaengÕs struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a childÕs life itÕs there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
10476	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
10481	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.	1	1		1																					
10486	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0		0																					
10498	4	"The last paragraph in, ÔÕWinter Hibiscus,ÕÕ was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    "	2	1		2																					
10500	4	It means that she want to do it all over again. It the girl comfort zone - So that is what she does when she upset. That is what the story and the phase mean.	0	0		0																					
10503	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence saying Òwhen they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test againÓ because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when itÕs not there things aint right but when it comes back thingÕs then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this letÕs the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well"	2	1		2																					
10505	4	"Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had."	2	1		2																					
10509	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
10517	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of SaengÕs new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer."	2	2		2																					
10521	4	"The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test."	2	1		2																					
10522	4	"The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. ÒSaeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She wonÕt give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings."	3	2		3																					
10525	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were sheÕs gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
10529	4	"In the story ÒWinter HibiscusÓ by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end."	2	2		2																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10539	4	"The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driverÕs test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence."	3	2		3																					
10542	4	"The author concludes the story with this piece because she said Òa flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,Ó I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho SaengÕs wasnÕt. ÒNext year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad."	2	2		2																					
10547	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.Ó    "	2	3		3																					
10551	4	"To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  "	2	1		2																					
10559	4	"The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasnÕt home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. "	2	3		3																					
10560	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didnÕt even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10564	4	"The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, ÒPlants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood worldÓ (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, ÒA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung SaengÕs eyes now swept over her Ò(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, ÒIt felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center Ð just as she had known it would feelÓ (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail."	2	3		3

The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"".

The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
10591	4	"The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the ÒMadagascar periwinkleÓ growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  "	1	1		1																					
10596	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test.

When Saeng got home she had the white bud in the pot and her mother seen that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng to the shovel and did it he self. Having her realize she can take it again"	1	1		1																					
10602	4	"The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, ÒItÕs flowers arenÕt pretty, but itÕs strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. ÒIt shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, Òshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon seasonÉÓ It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that sheÕs leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world.

And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says ÒI will take the test again.Ó"	0	0		0																					
10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesnÕt want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0		0																					
10642	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart. But It seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2

""it is possible to lower the spread of this disease by hanging large nets over beds that protect people from being bitten as they sleep."" they cant afford nets  but we could use the national budget to solve that problem. it could also be used to make solar-powered cars so we don't need to use gas. if cars did not use gas the world would be less poluted. it would help the world a lot because it polutes the whole world and isn't good for the earth. but if we did find space exploration more, we could avoid human suffering from bombing. ""imagine how much human can be avoided if nations competed with planet exploring spaceships instead of bomb-dropping airplanes."" ""even the problem of hunger and proverty can be tackled by space exploration."" exploring planets is not a priority, but helping the earth and its people is. we can use the money to save people, or the earth, but space exploration helps avoid bomb-dropping planes. my conclusion is that space is not worth the money."	11	12		1				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

(26.3% of the tnb), 70 billion on education 14.8% of tnb), and 6.3 billion on renewable energy. now the 19 billion spent on space exploration can help many things on earth. for example people living in poverty. but i that money should be taken out of something else mainly because we aren't using much money for this to begin with. another reason why i think space exploration should continue is because it has led to many tangible benifits, especially in medicine. scientists monitoried astronauts health under stressful conditions like durning launch and return. in doing this, medical instruments were developed and doctors trained about human bodys reaction to stress. others may say that this shouldn't be a main priority now, but i think that space exploration is doing more than the eye can see. my last reason for space exploration is that we are solving some serious problems on earth. satellies in space that circle earth can monitor lots of land at once. they can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, etc. people can then use this info to improve the way we produce and distribute food. others may say that the money spent on this can go to start a program to develop clean energy. but we are also solving problems on earth. the 19 billion can go to helping people in poverty. but i think space exploration should continue because of the point i have made. so i explained why i think space exploration should continue. but maybe we can still help people in poverty by taking money out of other things. maybe we can even explore space a little less."	11	7		2				3	3	3	2			2	1	2	2

18346	7	"should we continue with space exploration? i think we should because it helps us eal with money. also, space exploration is important. one reason to continue to explore space is it might improve our life. it can improve your life by getting/being better medical, better machine, and even better food! some people might say, money will surely help us, but money can't tell you things, space can. some other people might say that money can be spent on other things. well, 19 billion dollars is not that much compared to the national defense that the us spends. another reason is that it can even stop wars! it can stop wars because of the people too focus/ busy with space and its benficial. space exploring is beneficial because before nasa allowed astronauts to go on missions, scientists had to find ways to monitor their health under stressful conditions. some people say it it won't stop wars, well, at least it lessons war, right? the last reason is that satellites that circle earth can monitor lots of land at once. it can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought and many more. we can use the information to improve the wat we produce and distribute food. some people that are agianst this says that nearly half of all americans alive have dificulty paying for housing, food and medicine at one point in their lives. well, if we use this way to look after the crops, there will be more crops and the price of things will go down after see the foods prices go down. some people may say that pollution from burning gasoline and oil is warming our air and ocean. a program to develope clean energy could be viewed as a worthy investment. i disagree with this statement/ poin of view/ position because clean energy takes up more money than going to space. going to space is more helpful because it can see the world in a big picture. going to space is very helpful because it is only 1.2% of the national budget. also because in space, we could be discovering ways to make what we have now into something better in the earth. satellites that monitor the earth is also very helpful to see what's wrong quickly. a few ways we could improve this problem is by having this problem is by having ads for it because it always make people believe it."	8	9		2				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

18639	7	"yes the author did convince me that space exploration is desirable. i think that space exploration can help with some problems on earth. maybe they invented something new to help train people to get in shape to go to outer space. for example, before nasa allowed astronauts to go on missions, they had to find a way to moniter their health under stress levels, they developed medical instruments that doctors use to learn about the human body's reaction to stress. nasa has also developed other inventions that have improved our lives suck as better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting. others think that space exploration is not desirable because the 19 billion dollars we spend on it could be spent on pvoerty and medical care for the poor. well, its not too much because there are people out there that spend that mich money on useless things when they could donate to the poor too. this essay basicaly explains why i think space exploration is desirable."	6	8		1				1	2	1	2			2	2	2	2

18650	7	we sould keep space travel becas there is lots of benifits to space travel. like it doesnt even take that much money to do space travel it is like 1.2 persent of the money that the goverment gives even if you give that money to other things it will barly make a diffrence. space travel inproves lots of things like it maid it so we have better exersis mushins. also we know how good people work wer ther are under stress thin it maid better aire plains now. with more trave poverty and sickness can be takeled becase you will learn more about medicsin wail doing space travel. that is why we sould keep doing space travel.	10	12		1				2	3	2	3			3	3	3	3								
18654	7	"the article i read about is all about space and money, the question is ""should we explore space when there is so much that needs to be helped on the earth?"" in my opion we shouldn't really spend alot of money on the space exploration. in the next paragraph i will explain why it shouldn't space exploration be used. i think space exploration, shouldn't be used because we really need help on the earth first! then we can focus on the space. right now the earth needs help. one of the things the earth needs help on is health issues. in africa, the disease that is dangerous called malaria needs to get that prevented, it only costs 5 dollars to buy net to put it over there beds, but people in africa cant be able to afford that. another reason why i think space exploration should stop for now is so scientists can find a healthier way to build cars& stuff so we can stop air pollution. so those are my reasons why i believe space exploration should stop for now, then worry about it later. my opponet thinks that space exploration should keep going. they think that because a million dollars are only 1.2% of the national government budgement. the u.s uses 670 million dollars on milatary (that is 26.3% of the national budget). we even spend 70 billion dollars spent on education (that is 4.8% of the budget) even the 6.3 billion dollars spent on newable (clean) energy. space can help the earth too. they're satellites that circle the earth monitoring alot of land at once. the satellites can track and measure the conditions of crops, rainfall, soil, drought etc. so that's why they my opponet thinks space exploration is more important and shouldn't stop. back to the question should we explore space when there are bigger problems in the earth? my opinion i think it should stop. whats your opinion on this?"	8	8		1				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
18661	7	"should we continue space exploration? should we continue exploring the space? in my opinion i think we should because if we didn't, we won't be able to know what's happening outside of the world. in the passage nasa found out alot of ""good"" new uses to improve the world. also the amount of money used for space research is much lower than funding schools and nation defense. some people disagree with me, because funding space exploration is too much money well... when other countries bomb us, that will cost more space scientists might not find out how to make the ""planet exploring spaceship"" one day and that would save us a lot of money. i remember my science teacher telling me that the world will end one day, but not in our generation. what if scientist found that we could live on other planets that would be great. if space exploration gets stopped, one day... one day everyone will regret it. space exploration is a good funding project because it improved working machines, airplanes, and weather forecasts. without those improvement, we won't be able to feel safe. that's why i agree with continuing space exploration. if you agree with me great. if you don't one day you will regret it."	9	8		2				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2								
18662	7	"yes, the author convinced me that we should still explore space even though we have problems on earth. because we can find ways to actully help earth with its problems. for example the weather forcasting helps us see if its gonna be raining or if its gonna be hot. so lets say its gonna be raining the next day but you dont know because its a little bit sunny in the morning and you leave your house with a tanktop shorts and sandals and a couple hours later is starts pouring. instead of that happening to you you can check the weather before you leave your house with apropiate type of clothing. and learning about space helped us invent airplains. without airplains you have to lets say walk or drive or take a bus to like mexico or el salvador to visit you family thats why exploring outer space helps us with stuff we need on earth."	9	9		1				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3								
18672	7	"the aurother did convince me that space exploration is disarable because space could be inportant in the future and it could improve our community and its a bothersome to tear down nasa and fire all the workers, then rebuild everything back. another thing is that nasa dosent spend that much because 19 billion is 1.2% of the national budget and we shouldn't spend 670 billion dollars or 26.3% of the national budget on self defense and use some of the money to help provirety or global warming. the technology will improve and we could have technology we never got before and it could improve our weapons so we wo'nt need so much self defense. we should unite to teamwork and we should put more money to education so we learn efficently and our soldiers would be skilled when they grow up and be more learn faster and be skilled in battleing. another fact is that space is very safe because proffesionals test astronauts before they go to space. astronauts have to be healthy so there would be a better chance that they could survive and proffesionals see if there ready to go into space."	9	8		2				3	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
18675	7	my opinion is that we should cut space exploration for right now. there are way more other problems we could be dealing with other than flying in space. earth has many problems like poverty and world hunger. one example is that people in africa are dying from malaria and how $5 nets could save their lives. second we could be using the 19 billion dollars on education. right now in the u.s. funding for public schools is very scarce. another reason why we shouldnÕt is because there is so much pollution in the world that 19billion dollars could help create clean energy. there are opposing reasons for space exploration. they are better technology and medicine. they came up with better technology for space that can also be used in the daly life of humans. advances in medicine have also been made. while astronauts went up in space they needed to figure out a way to monitor their stress levels and so they came up with new ways to do so. in conclusion i think that space exploration can be held off for the moment. so instead we can work on other problems.	8	6		3				2	2	2	2			2	2	1	1								
18677	7	"i think they should spend money on space because it doesn't require as much money as other things. the us spends 670 billion dollars for national defense (26.3% of the national budget). the money on space exploration is 16 billion dollars which is only 1.2% of the national budget. nasa might even invent something new that can benefit our lives. some examples of inventions are exercising machines and better airplanes. these also helped make some travel possible. finally, it can cause compitition with other nations. it is better for us to build spaceships for compitition rather than building bombs for a war. an example is the cold ear in 1960. the us and russia had a race to see who could land a space craft on the moon. this led to a growth in america education, especially math and science."	8	9		1				2	2	2	2			2	3	2	2								
18685	7	"the article convinced me that the space exploration is desirable, because look even if you seen science exploration it won't help out that much with people needs. but if we use science exploration as a conflict between nation instead of having war then we can use the 670 billion dollars that was suppose to be for war. if i was you would you rather stop war and have science conflicts or have wars which will take more money away from people to treat others. when there is wars people use weapons that can produce gas. if you want war to continue but space exploration to stop your polluting earth way more. my very first reason that it is just not a reasonable choice to blow it on space exploration. if you look at the passage called tangible benefits of space exploration it should clearly come to out mind that national defence was at least 30 time more that space exploration. if we say the 19 million dollar should've went to the people read passage 1. there is 46.2 million people if i were you 19 billion dollars wouldn't ever be enough for that much people, but if you use the 670 billion i'm sure thats enough to provide everything. the wars cause more pollution on the earth think about how much gas produced and bullets flying everywhere on earth. won't that pollution even more than ever? so like i said there is no point of saying 46.2 million people is suffering from 19 billion dollars being used for space exploration. and to be fair the money wasnt even taken by them. if you were to add all the percentage of money used it only adds up to 50% and national defense is half of that. wouldn't 670 billion dollars be able to help them at more than 19 billion. if you take too much, used for space exploration tis could also prevent new discoveries. what do you know we might even find a cure you dont know. space explorations improved our lives like on 3 paragraph of passage 2 saying we get better exercise machines, better airplanes, better weather forecasting. if we didn't have space exploration we wouldn't have discoveries these scientist also found ways to relieve stress. this is why we shouldn't stop investing in space exploration."	12	8		2				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	2								
18712	7	"yes, the author convinced me that ""space exploration is desirable when there is so much that needs to be done on earth."" he convinced me by giving a lot of examples and details in the article. for example, going on space explorations can help us invent more advanced technology then we have now. going on space explorations can also lower the amount of people dying in wars by racing. it can also extend our knowledge, therefore finding cures, or possibly help make money for people in poverty. in my opinion, [i agree with where the author wrote about the amount of money used on space projects.] 19 billion dollars compared to 670 billion dollars is like a 25.1% difference. 25.1% alone is like a quarter of the budget. the investments helped by having better exercise machines, better planes, and more accurate weather forecasting. this is my aurspuino on this question."	8	6		1				2	2	2	2			2	2	1	1								
18716	7	"it's okay to do space exploration once in a while, like the author said. even if there are problems on earth, it shouldn't be a problem if you can balance. one thing the author mentioned is that 19 billion isn't a lot of money. it is 1.2% of the national budget. the government can use the other amount of money for people living in poverty. some benefits of space exploration are satelites, which monitors land. they can help plants or crops grow faster. this makes us strive for better inventions that might affect the future. you shouldn't [illegible] space exploration. it helps us too, and possibly reduce poverty and damage going to the environment."	8	10		1				2	2	2	2			3	3	2	2								
18720	7	"this argument has acually convinced me to go and give a ""thumbs up"" with space travel. because when you create space ships, you get differrent ideas how to make life better on earth. also, when the article says that the sattelites circling earth can track and help earth with info given like rainfall, droughts, etc. that can help people in poverty and people can give the people in need of food, water, medicines, and shelter those evait things. space travel will also be good because we can learn more about our galaxy and others. we can also find a new kindof, energy source that might give us cleaner energy!"	5	5		1				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	2								
18736	7	"the author has given great audience on the question of space travel. space exploration should be desired by many people, for it has given them better instruments that have improved life, and by improving life, they also improved earth. one way they have improved life is by improving health. before they would let anyone go into outerspace, they had to creat medicine and machines that would help them survive. as the author mention on page one, ""before nasa allowed astronauts to go on missions, scientist had to find ways to monitor their health under stressful conditions."" as people are in outter space, it proves that they found a way to monitor that. how this helps life, is that when they found a way to monitor the conditions under stress and gave that to doctors and scientists so that they can understand all these things that people do and catch under stress. flying in outterspace didn't only bring us rockets, but better inventions too. ""better exersize machines, better airplanes, and better weather forcasting,"" wrote the author (pg.1). people got better fitness after they invented new exersize machines, they got places faster after they invented better airplanes and we got to know if it was actually about to storm after the new weather forecasting machines."	8	8		1				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

18834	7	"after reading this passage, ""the importance of space exploration"", i have been convinced that we should keep on exploring space. i have been convinced because space exploration could actually help us solve our problems down here on earth, not that much money is used on it, and it helped us avoid a war. first of all, exploring space could actually help us solve our promblems on earth. for example, satellites can help monitor crops and the weather. this could help us improve the way we grow and ship our crops. also, not that much money is used on space exploration when you compare it to the money spent on national defense, education, and renewable energy. 670 billion dollars are spent on national defense, while only 19 billion dollars are spent on space exploration. 70 billion dollars are spent on education, which makes 19 billion dollars seem like a small amount of money. finally, space exploration helped us avoid war. in the 1960's, instead of having a war where lots of people get killed and severely injured, we had a space race instead. in conclusion, the author convinced me by giving me lots of reasons why we should keep on exploring space. i hope space exploration keeps going."	8	9		2				2	2	2	2			2	3	2	2

18844	7	"space exploration? 19 million dollars are spent on space exploration when that money could be grately benefited from other causes. i think that space exploration is not nessessary for a plethora of reasons. fifteen percent of america's population lives in poverty. that is over 46.3 million people and about half of all americans have difficulty paying for housing, food, and medicine at one point in their life. if we cut space exploration out of the national budget, the money used to fund that program would help improve the lives of many. for example, people affected by diseases may not have the money to pay for medicine or cures. also in other countries, people are dying because they do not have access to clean water, medical care, and (as i stated before) simple solutions to prevent the spread of diseases. only 4.8% of the national budget is spent on education. it is hard enough for public schools to keep the visual and performing arts (vapa) classes still within the curricular, but with extra money from the space exploration, it could be used to provide more classes of vapa, sports, and academics. how are we expected to succeed in life if the education department doesn't have enough money to supply us with better curricular cources. along with poverty and education, the earth is suffering also. because of excessive gas and oil use, it is harming the air we breath and our oceans. we could be able to use the money for new, cleaner forms of energy to power cars, homes, and factories. overall, i think that cutting the space exploration program would benefit americans greatly by decreasing poverty, getting better education, and bettering the earth. 19 million dollars is a lot of money and should be used on things that matter."	4	6		2				1	1	1	1			2	2	1	1

18849	7	"after reading the article i believe that space exploration should keep going on. one example is that ""satellites that circle earth can see lots of land at once"" this is important because the satellites can send back photos of poor and places in need so we can help them. another example is ""imagine how much human suffering if nations competed in planet exploring spaceships insted of bomb dropping planes"". there wan an example of this between the u.s and russia who both wanted to be the first to go into space and be on the moon, they both made good technology but there were a lot of threats though. it would be nice if people could just explore space peacfuly and not hurt peoples lives because of it. my final piece of evidence is that ""the investment in space exploration is especially worthwhile because it lead to many tangible benfits, for example, in the area of medicine. before nasa allowed astronouts to go to missions, scientists had to find was to monitor their heath under stressful conditions. ""this evidence prooves that the astronouts are safe and so are we, with satellites sending us information about other countries we can help them too. therefour i maintain my position that space exploration should keep going on."	8	10		2				2	2	2	2			3	3	2	2

18888	7	"i say space exploration is a good thing, it helps improve our mathematic, science, technology skills. finding the right way to build rockets, satellites, and rovers takes a lot of skill and education in all three. sending satellites help monitor out earth's crops, soil, rainfall, and weather. satellites also detect near by objects like meteors, so we are aware how close one is from earth. nasa scientists have developed many products that helped our lives, including airplanes and exercise machines. space exploration helps us discover what earth is surrounded by. the space machines allow us to discover more information about planets and stars in and out of our galaxy. one day we possibly will find life in another planet, most likely not in our galaxy, but other galaxies. we invest 19 billion dollars on space exploration, it might sound like a lot, but that is only 1.2% of the total national government. that is not nearly as much as how much we spend on military, 670 billion dollars. it would be better if we cut down on military fund, no other country spends nearly as much. we could be using that money for proverty and ways to stop polution."	8	8		1				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

18904	7	"i think that they should fund space exploration, because of two reasons. the first, is that the money spent for space exploration is little, compared to the national budget. the second, is that nasa, a space program, improved the earth's technology. space education only spends 1.2% of the national government's budget. the rest of the budget is spend on education, national defense, renewable energy, etc. space education is only using a bit of the government's budget. nasa is a space program that builds and designs technology, mostly for and about space (the space with the start and planets not the other word definition."" the earth's technology has improved because of nasa. the opposing side might say that space education effects the earth and people. it adds to global warming and pollution. the fossil fuels burned for space rockets to launch, adds more pollution to the earth. they also think that the money used for space education should be used to help the poor/poverty. since the poor don't have money or a place to live, they die of hunger, dehydration, mosquito bites, etc. if the government funds space education, there could be better technology in the future."	8	6		1				1	1	3	3			0	2	2	2

""in other countries, people are dying because they don't have access to clean water, medical care, or simple solutions that prevent the spread of diseases."" in africa, many pepole suffer from malaria, a disease spread from mosquito bites. they cannot afford $5 nets that may lower the spread of disease. this money can help fund medical care for all those who need it. exploring space should not be a priority for now, but maybe in the future. ""it is not just people that need help."" the earth is suffering because of all the fossil fuels we burn. the pollution is harming our air and oceans. we should have new types of energy that will not be harmful to the earth. all of this money for space exploration can be put to good use to help save the world. this way, we can then in the future explore space. what my opponent is not saying is that other things are more important than exploring space for new worlds. it would take longer to find a new world than it would to find a new source of  energy. if we didn't find a way to stop pollution, we won't be able to find new places to live on. the present is our first priority, then the future. the present comes before the future. so in conclusion, i believe that space exploration should be stopped. the funding should be put to other uses. it can help people live longer and better. it can help us now and will improve the earth. space exploration is not needed and isn't desirable to me."	7	5		3				2	2	2	1			1	1	1	2

""every rocket fired is a theft from citizens that suffer hunger and poverty "" says one of our presidents. all in all, we should use our money wisely, and not for things that aren't needed."	8	8		3				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
19027	7	"this essay is going to be about spending money to explore in to space over help the earth. theres lots of stuff to study on the earth. theres people who are poor and we need to help the planet a little bit more. but exploring in to space is to know more about the plants in the solar system, to help teach kids about science. in my point of view i agree that we need to teach more about the plants in our labor system and how they work. we would learn more about the planets if they go into space. they need to learn more about the earth but we also need to know about other planets in space and we would know what is the sun for. we learned about the earth and why it rotate around the sun. and how there is a core, we need water to live, how the weather is like. why there is a sun. childrens need to learns more education in there life and to be in school to learn new thing about the earth. they spend lot of money going out to space and explore it and how the planets work, but it is worth it because we learn more from that. children in schools learned late and late about the earth. like the plants, weather, clouds, water, animals, volcanoes, and maybe whats inside the earth. but explore in space makes you learn even more about the planets in the solar system. it makes you learn even more about how the planets work it gives you lots and lots of information about how they work. it is really important to learn because when you grow up when you have a daughter or a son you can tell them about it and if they have questions they want to know like about the earth and how it works you are there for them learning is important. if the scientist didn't go to space and explore the planets then we wouldn't know about the planets. scientist are the ones who explored space and the earth how it works. it is great to learn more thing about the earth and the planets."	6	5		0				0	1	2	3			0	1	2	2								
19038	7	"yes, the author changes my mind that space exploration is desirable when there is so much that needs to be done on earth, because the author is right that 670 billion dollars is spent on defense of the us. that is much more than the 19 billion dollars spent on space exploration. also, the author wrote that we can now learn about space and our solar system now that astronauts can go to space. without space exploration, we wouldn't know so much about weather and the moon. i'm convinced that the us should spend only 100 billion on defense like most other countries. we should concentrate less on war and more on poverty. as the author writes, many people in africa suffer from malaria because of mosquito bites. some even die from it. and in the us, many people don't have homes or access to clean water and clothing. out money should be spent to stop poverty instead of defense and violence. last of all, the earth is suffering from global warming, because too many vehicles are on the road, and automobiles burn fossil fuels. fossil fuels are very bad for the earth, and they are greenhouse gases. greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. there is now an ozone hole where the ozone is thinner. ozone protects the earth from the ultraviolet radiation, but they are turning to oxygen atoms because the greenhouse gases turn into chlorine atoms, and chlorine atoms turn ozone into oxygen. when there is an ozone hole, the earth turns warmer. instead of paying for the military, we should spend more money on clean energy to save earth, like the author wrote. conclusively, space exploration should still be funded, but our taxes shouldn't go to defense."	9	6		3				2	2	3	2			0	2	2	2

""what do you mean moderation?"" you ask. i think that both sides of the argument have valid points. so, i've come to a conclusion that we should spend money on s.e. in moderation. i think we shouldn't spend too much of our budget on s.e. but enough to gain the benefits from it. i personally think we should spent more money in education considering that soon there will be too many jobs and not enough workers. the reason education could help prevent this is if more people graduate and become more applicable to jobs this would not be a problem. i think this is more important than s.e. in conclusion, i believe in moderation. i think we shouldn't spend too much money on s.e., resulting in less money spent in other categories. just enough to milk out the benefits. moderation!"	9	8		0				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2

Òit is possible to lower the spread of this disease by hanging large nets over beds that protect people from being bitten as they sleepÓ. that quote i found from an article called: Òa question to conciderÓ. the only problem with getting those nets, is that many people cannot afford them. we could be spending some of space exploration money on helping poor people buy those nets. another reason why we should stop spending so much money on space exploration is that there are problems on earth like pollution. if you think about it, our planet is a mess full of trash and horrible gases. we could take more of our time and part of the space exploration money to help prevent/ clean up our pollution. Òthe earth is suffering tooÓ states: Òa question to considerÓ that shows how important it is to protect our planet. finally, the last reason why we should use space exploration money on something else is that we just donÕt need to. we do not need to spend 19 billion dollars on it. other things, places, and people could benifit from that money. also, the article: Òa question to conciderÓ says: Ònearly half of all amaricans also have difficulty paying for housing, food, and medicineÓ that also proves that we could be spending the money on different things. in conclusion, spending 19 billion dollars each year on space exploration is wrong. we need to be improving our planet and helping the poor. using some of the money (or almost all of it) will benifit many of us."	6	8		3				2	1	2	1			2	2	2	2								
19401	7	"i think that space exploration is desirable. this is because space exploration helps with many things. for example, it helps learn more about math and science, it also helps us learn about medicine and how the body is like under stress. this shows that space exploration can do things for the world. space exploration helps put satellites all around the world. satellites do many things like talking on a cell phone needs a satellite to get the call, and send to the person and ones calling. satellites also monitors earth. we can track and measure things like crops, soil, and rainfalls. gpss also needs a satellite to find the best route that someone could go. this shows that space exploration helps a lot and it only cost 19 billion dollars, which isn't even 1ne-tenth of the national budget. even though this money used doesn't seem useful, it is. one kind of money that the national budget has is the national defense. the national budget uses 670 billion dollars or twenty-six and three tenth percent of the national budget. this amount of money is outrageous because there is barely any attacks on the u.s. the national budget can be changed and used better. the u.s doesn't need this much money for defense and just use about 100 billion dollars, they can use this money for diseases, school, energy, and space exploration. satellites can find suspicious events and then people can stop them. education can teach people more things can create new things that can protect or help the world. people can make advance weapons, tools, and satellites. this is some things that could happen if they lower the amount of money used for defense. earth can be a lot better to. one any is that we could find a way to make everything solar power. this way people won't need to use gasoline for most things. this will save money and won't pollute the earth, but help people. this is why i think the author convinced me that space exploration. i think that space exploration will help our world and not hurt it. we will have solutions for most things. space exploration is a cost of money that will help our world."	6	7		3				1	1	2	2			1	2	2	2								
19406	7	"after i read the article, the author has convinced me that the exploration is deserible that earth has so much to be done because, one true fact has convinced me which was space problems are not against peoples problems which i cored because it can also help solve your problem, that is one reason the author does not convince me to have so much to be done for earth. more evidence that has convinced me to go against the exploration in desire is that, their is not enough money for the space exploration, and they only have 19 billion dollars for the exploration space. in my own opinion i think that their should be more that 1.2% of the money for space exploration (little money) and it is consituted to be only half the budjet and the u.s national defence spends over 670 million dollars (which is 26.3% of the budget, and 70 million spent for childrens and adults education, that is why i agree with the author, that was my second reason why i agreed. last but not least i agree with the author, because nasa has helped us live and, even they improved our lives, also they are improving our lives by better, machine, airplanes and more, also the medical insurents had made doctors learn about the human stress and, they learned it."	12	11		2				3	3	3	3			3	3	2	3								
19409	7	"there are many reasons why continuing space exploration is beneficial. by looking at how space exploration can help problems on earth, by understanding that space explorations are a minor part of the u.s. budget and by seeing that excellent things can come out of beneficial competition with other countries, it is clear that space exploration should definately continue. space exploration may seem to have no benifits to the earth and people but it does. the nasa program, while finding ways to keep astronauts safe and healthy in space, came up with some very important medical discoveries. better machines such as airplanes and exersise machines have also been benifits. also, crops, and weather can be viewed from satellites which help the people of earth very much. space exploration takes up a very small amount of the u.s. budget only 1.2% infact. this is very different from the 26.3% that the military takes up. if space exploration had more money, it would and could be able to make even greater discoveries, but even with the small amount it has, it still has excellent benifits. benificial competition has showed usefull before in history. during the cols war, the u.s and russia had a ""space race"" to get to the moon. in the end there were many important advances in technology. if there was to be another, imagine the advances that could be made. space exploration is incredibly beneficial and by understanding these benifits it is clear why space exploration should continue."	10	10		2				2	3	2	3			2	3	2	3								
19413	7	"the importance of space exploration the article was telling the readers about the benifits of space exploration verses using the budget for serious problems such as disease, hunger, proverty, and the environment. i felt that the author was trying to convince the reader to side with space exploration. i do understand the benifits of space exploration in regards helping technology, but i feel that more money should be spent on humanity. the fact that 26.3% of our budget goes to national defence is concerning, but on the other hand america needs the best protection. i understand the facts and benifits, such as medical technoloy concerning stress on the human body as a benifit. another fact that was interesting was that nasa helped to developed to improve airplanes, weather forcasting equiptment, and exercise machines. these are all benificial tools but we could have possible thought of this without space exploration. in conclusion, as a teen it's hard for me to understand the benifits of space exploration. but i can see that $5 isn't alot to protect people in africa from catching malaria from mosquitos. my family has been on of the half of american's that has had trouble paying for food, housing, and medicine. so i think more money should be used on humanity and our future and some can be used for space as well."	11	11		1				3	3	3	2			3	3	2	3								
19425	7	"we should fund space exploration. it has helped people on earth too. we've developed new medical innovations and learned more about stress and how to react to it. scientists have developed better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting. even hunger and poverty can be helped by the space program. they can monitor rainfall, temperature, and know if there's drought and people can distribute goods to them. the space programs have provided challenges and making us strive for better technology. it keeps us a creative society. it inspires us to make innovative inventions. space exploration is good for beneficial competitions among nations. it makes us improve spaceships and space technology instead of improving bombs and bombing up planes. in the 1960s there was a space race which improved our math and science by a lot. so as you know by now there are many things space exploration can improve, like our technology, math, science, etc."	7	6		2				2	2	2	1			1	2	2	1

19431	7	"i think we shouldn't fund the money, because if we do, the money would just be for the future. we should spend it on the earth because we are not living in the future. if we spend it on the earth, we can fixed the problems we have now earlier. don't fix it later. some evidence i have to support this is satellites that circle earth can monitor lots of land at once. they can also track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, etc. which is bad because it takes up alot of time doing that, but if we do use the money on earth and not the space exploration thing, everything would be happy and all right. there is alot of things, that needs to be done on earth. the money should be spent instead to help heal people and the earth. the evidence i have to support this/why we shouldn't fund the money is the government spends 19 billion dollars, i think that's too much. how about we can use that money for the earth? see, it would make it better. in the paper it says ""imagine how much human suffering can be avoided if nations competed with planet exploring spaceships."" but even if they do, do that, it will still hurt people. like something falls/breaks in space and then it came flying back to earth and t would cause even more trouble than before. another evidence i have to support this is president eisenhower opposed the space program because of the spaceships. well, i agree with him and so should you because the spaceships they have right now is huge and have tons of gas/bad ones that can make people sick. but if we fund it, these ships get even bigger than before. and why does people wants to go see space. i mean like come on there is plenty of things to see on erath and not on space. you can also die in space. spending the money on earth will make the earth better in a way. spending the money on space will make the earth bad. wouldn't you want to spend the money on earth because you live on earth and you want to make it a better place. make the earth even healthier with the money, because if you spent it on space, your not really making it better. it's useless to give your money to the space, give it to the earth and you'll be happy and very thankful that you did. do you really think space need the money? think about the earth and how can we change it to make it better and fix the problems it has now, so later in the future, it won't even have a problem. the last thing i'm going to say is think about the earth and it needs. because your going to live on earth for a very long time. think about the earth and it's need, you could help change it."	10	10		1				2	3	2	3			2	3	3	2								
19435	7	"after reading the article, i believe that space exploration should continue based on the provided reasons. on reason is that, ""...to meet the challenges of space exploration, nasa scientist have developed other innovations... which means that having space exploration scientist can make helpful inventions that can be used for space exploration as well as for day-to-day working. one example is the exercising machine, which astronauts use to train for outer space. is improved by space scientist and the machines have a dual effect. they can be both for people going to the gym and for space training. the article also states, ""even the problems of hunger and poverty can be tackled by space exploration."" this means that with space exploration we can not only explore space, but also help solve hunger and poverty! satellites launched can detect the condition of crops, weather, soil, etc. another example from the article states, ""finally, space exploration is important because it can motivate beneficial competition among nations."" this means that nation can compete over beneficial areas, such as least pollution and space exploration, instead of over a war. space exploration can indirectly stop soldier from war and less money wasted during wars. one example is the cold war. this is a time period were the us and russia competed over who could get the first person on the moon. see how it is a ""war"" but not a war? this can help out world to become united and a whole. for these reasons, i maintain my position that the space program should be kept."	9	8		2				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2								
19443	7	"in the report, ""the importance of space exploration"", the author states how space exploration, or the funding for it, benefits us and how it affects us. then, at the end of his report, he states how the benefits of paying billions of dollars for exploring space outweigh the disadvantages because of the ways it can help us. i believe that, or i agree with the author that we should continue to fund space exploration to have the major advantages that would improve the condition we would've had if we just funded our money to poverty. the advantages of space exploration really benefit the society and economy in numerous ways. for example, as it says in the report, ""scientists had to find ways to monitor different astronaut's health under stressful conditions, a benefit in the field of medicine. also, when nasa was trying to meet the challenges of space exploration, better exercise machines, airplanes, and wheather forecasting was achieved because of it. the author goes on to say how space exploration can tackle the problems of hunger and poverty because of how satellites can track and measure the condition of crops, soil, rainfall, drought, and other things that can improve the way we produce and distribute food. so basically, when we fund space exploration, as the author states in the report, we are also saving some serious problems on earth. even though there are many advantages to funding space exploration, there are also a few disadvantages. one disadvantage is that since the government spends $19 billion on space exploration, which opposers of space exploration think its a lot of money prefer that the money used for it should be used ""to help heal the people and the earth."" also, it said that the money funded for space should be given to people who are in poverty and /or people who cant afford clean water, medical care, and housing, which relates to healing the earth. in all, despite the few disadvantages of space exploration funding, the advantages tackle, or outweigh the cost or affects. in the future, space exploration may solve all the problems we have on earth."	10	9		3				2	3	2	3			2	2	2	3								
19444	7	i think that we shouldn't go up to space it's because if we let it happen there will be more pollution (global warming will happen). also there is dangerous things outside of earth. which means we waste supplies and materials which cause global warming. we also waste cash if we need a new air planes or space ships. even though people want to go to space they have to think if it ok to go out of earth. like fir example if a astory was about to crash to earth and was aimming for the shuttle and the shuttle lifted up there would be a huge problem. (adding on) even though theres going to be new models of planes so what. who care. it's still the same.	5	8		0				1	1	1	2			2	2	2	2								
19447	7	"space exploration is exciting however, it should not be out priority. i believe that the money that goes into space exploration should be in something that is needed like people who do not have access to clean water, food, and medical supplies and are dying. 19 billion dollars are going into space travel. people think that most of the money should be spent healing the people and the earth. its not just the people that need help but the earth to. many scientists believe the earth is being poluted by burning fossil fuels (gasoline + oil) is effecting our air + oceans. a program to develop clean energy would be a worthy investment"	9	9		1				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3								
19464	7	"yes he did convince be because millions of people in the world are starving and the goverment is spending 419 billion dollars a year while many people are homeless, jobless, and hungry. i think it is stupid how the goverment used Òthe space raceÓ to spend lots of money on it. Òthe space race,Ó led to significant investment and progress in american education, especially in math and science. nearly half of all americans also have difficulty paying for housing, food, and medicine at some point in their lives. plus the goverment spends 19 billion dollars a year to done space exploration. that really could go to the homeless, or to give money to the mentally challenged people. over 46.2 billion americans live in poverty. also each rocket sent ooterspace was a theft from citizens that suffered from hunger and poverty. it isnÕt just us people suffering the earth is too. pollution from oil is messing up the air, and with the 19 billion dollars the goverment uses we can buy cleaner energy to power, cars, houses, and factories. even though we (earth) has been improved by space exploration, billions of people are starving, have poverty, and donÕt have enough money to go to college. also we can have better education. when nasa taking away all of the goverment money they are taking part of our lives, the goverment is putting too much trust in nasa when they only find little things each year then they more les and say they have found some kind of rock that could become a neuclear, when they are trying to cover up their lies by say non-realistic things. then the goverment just  keeps on funding into it."	9	7		0				2	2	2	3			2	2	1	2								
19465	7	"in my opinion i think that we should fund space exploration. i believe this because the money that nasa uses is only 1.2% of the national budget. compared to the other 98.9% that is a very small amount. also space exploration has contributed to many benefits as i will explain in the next paragraph. some of the benefits were in the area of medicine, travel, forecasting, and exercise. for medicine the scientists studied what would happen to the astronauts health under stressful conditions and invented new medical instruments. for travel when they created the space shuttle they learned more about arrow dynamics and learned how to have a smoother flight with less turbulence. for forecasting they sent satellites into space and got a more accurate reading on the weather. last but not least for exercise they built better exercise machines. space exploration has brought more benefits then downfalls."	4	3		1				1	1	1	1			1	1	1	0

19473	7	"in my opinion i think with 19 billion dollar, many life can be saved. with that much money the malaria diesease can be prevented with five dollar nets. but funding nasa for their space project are also needed. with satellites they can predict weather outcome and also prevent many death as well from natural disasters. i don't think all the fund should go to nasa alone. part of the fund should go to help people as well. they claim that instead of war they will have friendly compitition like heading to the moon. but war will always continue unless the entire world is dominated by a single nation alone. my point is earth needs more help then space where we don't live on. the fund should mostly go help people as global disaster are happening. for example global warming that is causing huge problem to the world as well as the japan nuclear meltdown which they refince help from america. with all these problem happening on earth, we have more need than a race against space. a billions of dollar race isn't what we need today."	8	12		2				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

In addition the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3 ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". With the law in the way no one would even want to try. Those are the three major problems found when building the mast"	4	3		4																					
14975	6	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, engeneers fused several obstacle when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the @CAPS1 state Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, there @CAPS2 problem was ""the stress of the dirigiblel's load."" With all this weight being transmited to the buildings foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation This was verry expensive todo. Sixty thousand dollars wer nesciary.Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked The winds would toss it around. A solution was putting waights at the back of the landing fields, but the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrans on the street"" like explaine in paragraph @NUM1.

14977	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	3	3		3																					
14978	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" (¦ @NUM1) because it ""would add stress to the building's frame"". (¦ @NUM1) this was a difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"" (¦ @NUM3), there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above New York City. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¦ @NUM4). The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" (¦ @NUM5) This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (¦ @NUM5) Some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws."	4	4		4																					
14979	6	Some of the Problems they faced building the emPire State building was the hight. building a buildig that high up and also epecting it to do things such as bording dirigibles.

14983	6	"The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with."	2	2		2

The second one is that they have a law aganist airships, ""was an existing law aganist airships flying too low over urban areas"". The also have have the problem is that the dirigible will be dangling high above people reads, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". This is some of the problems that they have."	3	3		3																					
14986	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																					
14989	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure."	2	3		3																					
15000	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
15004	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."	4	4		4																					
15005	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropt, though some ships have tried to dock their."	3	3		3																					
15008	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building"	3	3		3																					
15010	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were accidents over densely populated areas, violent air currents constantly shifting, etc."	1	1		1																					
15016	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were the winds in the high altitudes, the laws that didn't allow airships to be so close to an urban area, the safety of the passengers, and the safety of the pedestrians below."	2	2		2

One proble they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg. Then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easly crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstical builders would have to over come was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally."	3	4		4																					
15033	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards.

Now he didnt @CAPS2 look into it if a blimp was to @CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the buildings foundation.

15043	6	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (LŸsted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (LŸsted, @NUM2).

The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	4		3																					
15056	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles."	2	2		2																					
15063	6	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."	4	4		4																					
15069	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
15074	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3		3																					
15077	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2

They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower.

One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City.

15100	6	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons.

As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast.

Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself.

The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building.

Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps.

15158	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles."	3	4		4																					
15161	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen."	4	4		4																					
15172	6	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face."	2	2		2																					
15191	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed."	3	3		3																					
15203	6	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."	3	4		4																					
15210	6	"In the excerpt the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing reality. For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas. Also they realized major would play a negative role. Wind would cause the @CAPS2 to swing around all Docked. They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a @ORGANIZATION1 population. Overall they began to realize saftey issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this."	3	3		3																					
15218	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.	2	2		2																					
15225	6	"Allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building, would leave architects faced with challenging sinerio's. Adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame. A single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (LŸsted. @NUM1) The frame of the Building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was Because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (LŸsted. @NUM2). This makes travel out side the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds. ""The winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents."" (LŸsted, @NUM3). This wasn't practical nor safe. These obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come."	4	3		4																					
15232	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast"	1	1		1

Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled.     First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful."	4	4		4																					
15244	6	"Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down. Lastly, It wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason.""

Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems."	3	3		3																					
15250	6	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
15251	6	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.	3	3		3

15265	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house.

Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on.

Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp."	2	3		3

For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area."	4	3		4																					
15360	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. LŸsted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15366	6	"many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. "	2	2		2																					
15373	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""	3	4		4																					
15376	6	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
15379	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	3		3																					
15396	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15398	6	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if the decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from out side the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead wieght then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City.The final obstacle that biulders of the empire state @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the @ORGANIZATION1. They would not even be allowed to approach the @ORGANIZATION1."	4	4		4																					
15400	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail."	3	3		3																					
15403	6	"In constructing and building the empire State building to make it allowable for dirigables to dock there took alot of thinking on the builders' part. First they had to see what the building could handle and try to calculate what it held so it wouldn't fall. Then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders' put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public and the plan had to be shut down.

15414	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.

15417	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful."	3	3		3																					
15420	6	"The obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building do to the frame work Also the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."	1	2		2																					
15425	6	"The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished."	2	3		3																					
15429	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15435	6	"During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the @CAPS2 said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"".

""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the @CAPS2. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practicle nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles.

15440	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with, while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the hight of the building. That ment more frame work, more material, more safety hazards, all because of the buildings hight. Another obstacle was @ORGANIZATION3 safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also wip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and  unsturdy for passengers.

Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."	3	3		3																					
15449	6	"The Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are blimps. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building with just the size. The Empire State building was very competive with the Chrysler Building. Some oppinions were ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpast, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.

There was many trials and tribulates making the Empire State building."	1	1		1																					
15451	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15455	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea."	3	3		3																					
15458	6	"The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers."	2	2		2																					
15460	6	"When constructing a mooring mast, @CAPS1 ran into many problems. Safety was the main problem/concern they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the @LOCATION1 were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in @CAPS1 feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful."	3	4		4																					
15461	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. "	3	3		3																					
15464	6	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe.

This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."	3	4		4																					
15471	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that.

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3

The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock."	3	3		3																					
15529	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below. Another problem the builders faced was safty. The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a plan failed."	3	3		3																					
15530	6	"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way."	4	4		4																					
15540	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
15546	6	"The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15548	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
15549	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."	3	3		3																					
15551	6	"The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles."	3	1		1

While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties."	3	3		3																					
15561	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, LŸsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As LŸsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful."	3	4		4																					
15562	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field."	4	3		4																					
15566	6	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obsticles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steal frame.This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles making their dreams quite impossible."	4	4		4																					
15573	6	"When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful."	3	3		3																					
15574	6	"While in the process of building the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architecs would add @NUM2 dollers worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accomodate dirigibles saftey issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the disaster in New Jersey they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Lastly their is an existing that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Which this would clearly violat. With all these obstacles to overcome the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded."	4	3		4

To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe."" This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.""

The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building.

15594	6	Based on excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles were that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	3		3

As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3		3																					
15622	6	"When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled."	3	3		3

(paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal.

Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?"	4	3		4

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable.

15718	6	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the wind. The captain feared he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured. ""[He] could not even take his hands off the control lever."""	3	3		3																					
15723	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.	2	3		3																					
15730	6	"Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service."	1	2		2																					
15735	6	"In the @DATE1's people did not have technology like we had today, they didnt know what they were really even doing. when the architecks were builing The @CAPS1 state builing they had many problems. First they couldnt just drop a mast on there because as they said in the story the roof was not flat. Next it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame and last they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof. All in all men in the @DATE1's had a lot of work to do while building the Empire State Building."	1	1		1																					
15739	6	"The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers."	2	3		3																					
15741	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 were the obstacles."	2	3		3																					
15744	6	"Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
15745	6	"While the Empire State Building was being built the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right of the bat, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185-foot spire inside, and made this building now @DATE2, 46 ft taller then the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
15748	6	"The obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety. Safety was important because of how many people there are in New York. Another problem was the dirigibles outside the United States were hydrogen instead of helium. At such a high height the wind is very strong and the blimps are only being held by the front while the back would swing uncontrolably. A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15762	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents."" Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening."	2	2		2																					
15767	6	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4		4																					
15783	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles"	4	4		4																					
15788	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¦ @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey and the Empire State building owners realized how bad a fire could be in downtown New York, which is densely populated. Secondly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area"" (¦ @NUM2), which would make even trying to approach the building illegal. Lastly, nature was not going to change and suddenly cooperate for one project and it was unpredictable when or if the weather would permit docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (¦ @NUM3). Sounds safe, or practical? Definitely not.

The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object.

One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3

If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame.

The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank.

Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets.

15930	6	"In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties"	3	4		4																					
15933	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it."	2	3		3																					
15944	6	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¦ @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."	4	4		4																					
15945	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the buildings framework because docking a dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible.

One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway. Another issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the dirigibles."	2	2		2

Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¦ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible.

An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. The mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas.

At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely.

This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out.

Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down.

Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area.

Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame.

They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas.

""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."	4	4		4																					
16109	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4		3

The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2		2																					
16112	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2		3

A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's.

I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with.

16128	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1."	4	3		4																					
16129	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields with the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was nether practical nor safe. The builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles."	2	3		3																					
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
16134	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																					
16139	6	"There were a few obstacals to making this idea work. one of the obstacals was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind.

16140	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4		4

A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¦ @NUM3).

16158	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	3		3																					
16160	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived."	4	3		4																					
16161	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																					
16171	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

16173	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4.

Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire state building were always changing due to violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low over urban areas.

The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	3	4		4

For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down.

If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe.""Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas.""

""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell.""

Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration."	3	3		3

The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing.

The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""	3	3		3

Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low.

As an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be.

There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction.

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low.

Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public.

After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath.

The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg.

16446	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to put the mast at the top. This process would be very costly, the author says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent that high up. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" therefore it would not be safe for people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law said that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems, and their plan never actually followed through."	3	3		3																					
16448	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire state Building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose."	4	4		4																					
16452	6	"In order to build the Empire State building, some Of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engeineeres and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it."	2	1		2																					
16455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3		3																					
16457	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious saftey hazard by spinning the back of the docked dirigible around. Also dirigibles are highly flammable. If an explosion such as the Hindenburg took place at the top of the Empire State Building it would have been catastrophic. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous: It was illegal. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2)The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extreemely dangerous, was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting task. Builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After researching, builders reliezed that they would have to strenghen the frame. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (paragraph @NUM3) The obstacles the builders faced, proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring."	4	4		4																					
16462	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The @CAPS1 Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building One obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable @CAPS2 if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York. The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originaly planned"	3	3		3																					
16465	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, the dangers of allowing dirigibles that were made outside of the United States. May non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible LŸsted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were to wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were thethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon LŸsted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigibles on the Empire State Building illegal."	3	3		3

16477	6	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Mast was doomed to fail before it began. The greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety. The hydrogen, in most dirigibles, is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town New York. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the Mast. Violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The Mooring Mast was doomed to fail before they began building it. The greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety. The dirigibles were never able to land there."	2	3		3																					
16489	6	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develope a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building. the architects also had to do extra research to develope the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe secure way. These obsticles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream."	3	3		3																					
16491	6	"The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise."	3	3		3																					
16494	6	"Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built.One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky. Another, obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. Their was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was discussed a lot of time and money would have been saved."	3	3		3																					
16496	6	"Marcia Amidon LŸsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3																					
16500	6	"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out."	3	3		3																					
16503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	4		4																					
16511	6	"The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below. And since they had to do that The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation"	2	1		2																					
16512	6	"Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below."	1	2		2

""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure wood have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below."" That was another obsticle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obsticle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The idea was neither practicle nor safe."	2	3		3																					
16515	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it.

16523	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.

16532	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, and the most advanced form of @CAPS2.

While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3).

16537	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2

The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.

To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved."	4	4		4																					
16566	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4		4																					
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
16571	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
16573	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¦@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¦@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3

Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal."	3	3		3

The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use.

16581	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast."	3	4		4

First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3		4																					
16592	6	"In the excerpt  ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2		3																					
16598	6	"The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the to of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be to heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't made for that much weight. Some dirigible were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was to dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other particle reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This law wouldn't allow dirigible to land at the Empire State Building due to its location."	4	4		4																					
16606	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. It would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced."	1	1		1																					
16608	6	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building	3	2		3																					
16625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York."	2	2		2																					
16628	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below."	3	3		3																					
16632	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building is that they Could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law agains airships flying too low over Urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."	2	1		2																					
16633	6	"You want me to tell you what they had to go through in attempt to allow dirigibles dock there?! Well to tell you the truth they had to go thourgh a lot, like ""one obstacle the lack of a suitable landing area"", also another ""obstacle I would have to say is nature""! let me tell you why I picked these to obstacles. Keep reading! They want to dock the dirigibles at the empire state building. I say want because there plan did not work to many things was wrong. like the fact that they said ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing"" they couldnt find a good landing area for the dirigibles with out something bad happening. another ""obstacle they had was nature"" I say nature because if the wind blew it can blow away some people. So those are my main obstacles that they had to go through @CAPS1 to allow the dirigibles dock there."	2	2		2

20745	7	"space exploration isn't really desirable while there are still so many needs on earth. in the part ""a question to consider"", the author states that 46.2 million americans (15%), live in poverty. they can't get things that some of us just take for granted like medicine, heater, and even cars which allow us to travel to places in a short period of time. space exploration may be helpful in benefiting the area of medicine, but while astronauts' lives are also being risked to achieve this, people are dying quickly, and daily, it may take years to achieve even a little progress and by then, millions of people have died. another reasons space exploration isn't desirable (yet) is because it can wait. there are still many many years to go to space. you may say that it uses only 1.2% of the national budget, but, it's still billions of dollars. money can always be earned back so why not wait? lives on the other hand can't wait. they are being taken away quicker than you can get people in to space. once people's lives are secured on earth, space exploration would be a good idea. by the time that happens, the planets will still be there, space will also be there. finally, earth also needs help, not just its inhabitants (us humans, and animals). it is proven that pollution from burning fossil fuels is harming our air more than we realize. it doesn't make sense to try to help earth's people while sending space ships/shuttles (which use a lot of fuel) into space harms earth. if earth is harmed, we humans might not even be able to live/flourish here. i agree that space exploration is very important but now is not the time. i disagree that we should explore space now while earth has its own problems. space exploration does more harm than helping people."	16	18		3				3	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

21093	7	"one question that many people have considered is whether or not we should have space exploration. there are many good reasons for having or not having space exploration. i have read those reasons and have reached the conclusion that the research of space should go on for many reasons. first of all, space exploration can help our daily lives. in the essay that i have read, it states that space exploration can help develop better medicine, exercise machines, airplanes, and weather forecasting. this proves that space exploration can directly impact our lives for the better. many people use these things every single day. in addition, the cost for these benefits are relatively low. second of all, space exploration can unite people. for example, the war between russia and the united states for the first successful launch. this proves that space exploration can unite nations. in my opinion, a friendly fight over space exploration is better than an all out, war over land any day. it would prevent the loss of special family members all over the world. someone else might argue that we should focus on the problems on earth because we should make human situations better. this person has a good point, but space exploration is too important to give upon. like i said before, space exploration can contribute with medicine research and inventions that make life easier. we also need space exploration because earth will eventually become a place that we can't survive on. we need to find another planet to migrate too. therefore, space travel will help more with humans than little efforts to give money to the poor. in conclusion, we need space exploration. it contributes to things that make life easier for us. space exploration also inspires friendly fights between nations, which may prevent bloody wars. we also need a place to live on when earth goes to ship due to global warming."	20	20	42	2				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	6	5	4	3	5	4	5	4	4	4

""these include better exercise machines, better airplanes, and better weather forecasting,"" according to this many people would not get a good excersice; although, not every one excersices. but still many others would not be able to visit relatives in other countries without airplanes. people would not be able to recognize futere weather either. lastly, some one might say that these diseases would have still been cured overtime but how long would it have taken? i say that with so much stuff to do in earth that you say we don't have time to cure such little things. this is why it is good have space exploration. i think my opponent is ignoring the fact that space explorations can help solve the problem of hunger."	23	22		1				4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4

21351	8	"Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it.

21357	8	"Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS1 feel good, @CAPS1 feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  ""@CAPS1 don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out.""I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS1 are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS1 want to do? I don't think @CAPS1 would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS1 would want your friends or family make @CAPS1 laugh, so @CAPS1 can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS2 fine, @CAPS4 I @CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, ""@CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes @CAPS1 feel way better in the end."" I mean, @CAPS1 @MONTH1 feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS1 can @CAPS2 laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS2 be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS1 have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS1 can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS3 sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde."" @CAPS3 says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  ""@CAPS4 @CAPS1 laugh a lot. @CAPS1 will live life longer.""I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS1 can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter."	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4						
21358	8	"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. ""@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: ""@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS3 suggested. ""@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter."	23	23		46				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21360	8	" One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so then he put it back. Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me.  He said to me ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro"" I answered back. ""@CAPS1 you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat."" said the guy. "" @CAPS2 dude I did not take a hat"" I replied. ""@CAPS3.k. then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop.  ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is @CAPS2 reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3						
21385	8	" All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21387	8	" @CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?"	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21397	8	" When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
21407	8	"The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21422	8	" Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy."	21	20		41				4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21424	8	" Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3
21426	8	" When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3."	21	20		41				5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21428	8	"     In order to to laugh you have to be happy. I was once happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I've made me more dissapointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful babygirl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has effected me and my family. Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS1 over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority and when i get out I gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now.   In the @DATE1 I would have never guessed that I'd be here where I'm at now but when I get home I'm gonna put a smile on my brothers face and my parents and when I see my girl I'm gonna go give her the biggest smoochie boo kiss of her life so she'll cry and laugh."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21431	8	" Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, ""@CAPS2're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21432	8	" Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion."	27	20	50	50				6	5	6	6	6	5	4	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5
21436	8	" We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh."	18	19		37				3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	4						
21446	8	" Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry.There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes @CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in the own way. The world never be as one, their will always be war all the time forever on earth."	16	14		30				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	3						
21449	8	"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. "	16	16		32				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	3	3						
21452	8	" I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.  The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends,family,or a significant other."	17	16		33				3	4	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3

But @PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about @DATE1 paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. @PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON2's feeling that way made @LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS5 teletubies, went to @PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about @DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking @CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS6-@CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS6-@CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and @PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine."	18	20	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3
21454	8	" Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS4 know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS4 help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on."	21	21	42	42				5	4	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4

21478	8	" I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through."" @PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS11!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.  "	20	27	42	42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	6	5	5	6	5	4	4	5	5	5	4
21480	8	"  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter."	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21485	8	"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	3						
21488	8	" When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleas-er. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of loosing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my @CAPS1 count, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Anything from rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry which students thought was funny, and occasionally destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me. As I advanced into high school I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately loose my funny, humorous personality. I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a father level of being unhappy. That so called ""@CAPS1"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someones @CAPS1 who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her, it was just to hard for me. When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing!"	21	20		41				5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

21490	8	"  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5						
21500	8	" Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life."	17	20		37				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21507	8	" To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS3 or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS1 mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS3 things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS1 boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS1 credit card account was being help for @NUM1 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME1 when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS2 and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""@CAPS3 vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS1 bank and see what was going on with @CAPS1 account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS1 pin number to access @CAPS1 account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS1 account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS1 stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21513	8	"                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.

21530	8	" Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."	25	21		46				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	4	4						
21531	8	"   @LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my @CAPS1 @CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS7 or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.     Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter.  @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy."	23	27	50	50				4	4	4	5	5	5	6	6	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
21533	8	" My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!"	17	18		35				3	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21540	8	" Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21544	8	" I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS3 I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE1 @TIME1. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS1 versus and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON1,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS3 so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever."	15	16		31				3	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	3

I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how i felt, but it didn't hurt any more. I got better because laughter is the best medicine."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

21557	8	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."	18	25	42	42				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	4

It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, ""@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21563	8	" The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."	21	25		46				5	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21567	8	"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21569	8	" It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!"	18	16		34				3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3						
21573	8	" Hello my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS11 i am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences i have ever had. It is a story about me @CAPS11 my friends @CAPS11 a little adventure we had @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE1 air, @CAPS11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS11 meet up with his cousin ""@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by."" @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS11 looked an @PERSON1 @CAPS11 said ""lets go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS11 food @CAPS11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE1 loop @CAPS11 @CAPS10 what happened. ""@CAPS5 it is"" yelled @CAPS2 ""@CAPS5's the park i found it."" We looked off in the distance @CAPS11 @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS3 had @CAPS7 so @CAPS3 called them @CAPS11 had them come @CAPS11 unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS11 a half to find us @CAPS11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousins house @CAPS11 stayed @CAPS5 for the @TIME1. When we got @CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @CAPS11 warm clothes, ""looks like you guys have had a rough one"" @CAPS3 said, ""I'm @PERSON2, I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now."" @CAPS8 we changed in to the clothes @PERSON2 had given us we went @CAPS11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS5 @CAPS11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said ""i wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""we can"" @PERSON2 said, ""i know the perfect place."" @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house, @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS10, told you i had the perfect spot."" @CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS11 on through the @TIME1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, @CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends."	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21587	8	"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21620	8	" Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to."	18	15		33				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21621	8	" Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS1 as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS3's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS2 her house. When @LOCATION1 and I stepped in my house @CAPS3 was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS2 the sight of my step dad, @PERSON1 yelling @CAPS2 my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. ""I can't believe @CAPS1 just can't go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS1 would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,"" @PERSON1 said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS1 can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION1 had said, ""@CAPS1 don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS1 could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!"" @CAPS2 that point @CAPS3 was no going back @CAPS2 what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON1 began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS6 said some words that @CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS6 began to stutter. @CAPS6 spoke, ""@CAPS3 was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION1 wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON2's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand."" @CAPS3 was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS6 was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS6 immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS6 didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS6 couldn't take it away. @CAPS6 wanted possession of it so @CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS6 take away her phone, but @CAPS6 took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION1 and I continued laughing @CAPS6 ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS6 could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS3 was. Sad part was @CAPS6 even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS3 was nothing to say. @CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS6 had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but i had put the story as my status on @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 had saw. I didn't mention any names besides @LOCATION1 and I's, but the fact @CAPS6 knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry.  @PERSON1 began to wonder. My sister had said @CAPS3 was no toilet paper and when @CAPS6 asked if @CAPS3 was napkins she also said, ""no."" @CAPS6 started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. @CAPS6 was so mad, but @CAPS2 the same time laughing really hard. @CAPS6 felt like @CAPS6 should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step dad, @PERSON1 still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @CAPS6 said, ""@CAPS1 @MONTH1 think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when @CAPS1 don't have any toilet paper."""	24	20		44				5	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
